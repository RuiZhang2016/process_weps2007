Cheops, Feb. 1-03Photo by: Canadian Press / RCMPDescription: Sunday, February 02, 2003  REVELSTOKE, B.C. -- Seven teens on a high-school ski excursion in the treacherous back country of east-central B.C. died Saturday when a half-kilometre-wide avalanche roared down from a mountainside and engulfed their group.  It was the second deadly slide to hit the region in as many weeks. Seven adults perished in a slide in January. The dead were six boys and one girl, all in Grade 10 at Strathcona-Tweedsmuir School, a private day school on an expansive rural campus in the foothills southwest of Calgary.  The surviving students, the two teachers and parent chaperone were expected back in Calgary late Sunday night. Six of the students have some scrapes and bruises, and one male suffered a broken ankle. "We are absolutely stricken with grief. Our hearts go out to all those who are impacted," Tony Macoun, head of the school, said in a written statement.  Frantic parents gathered at the school Saturday night, arriving separately and in groups, embracing each other. No students were visible.  "Our school is a small family and loss this extreme is impacting us tremendously," said Macoun.  There were 17 people in the school group, three adults and 14 Grade 10 students in an outdoor education class, on their annual cross-country ski trip.  The avalanche occurred on Mount Cheops in Glacier National Park just before noon, said Pam Doyle, superintendent for Parks Canada in Revelstoke.  It happened on the north face of the mountain in Connaught Creek Valley section of Balu Valley, about five kilometres west of the Rogers Pass summit.  The group was led by two male teachers and a male volunteer. All had certification and back-country experience, Macoun said. The group had been skiing about 15 metres apart, with one supervisor in front and the other two bringing up the rear.  The skiers were halfway up the valley when the avalanche roared down the north slope, burying nearly the entire group.  Another group of young skiers witnessed the avalanche and were among the first to help.  A supervisor whose hand was just visible above the snow was the first to be dug out. Once freed, he called park wardens on a satellite phone to raise the alarm.  "Of the remaining students, six of the students are safe and one has a broken ankle," Macoun said in his statement.  The three leaders were uninjured and are attending to the survivors, who were in Revelstoke on Saturday night after being airlifted first to Glacier Park Lodge by helicopter.  Two people from the group were treated for minor injuries, said RCMP Sgt. Randy Brown.  The avalanche was "very powerful," with a rating from 3 to 3.5, compared with a top rating of 4, said Pat Dunn, a Parks Canada spokeswoman.  "The size 3 to 3.5 avalanche could destroy a building . . . or 10 acres of forest," she said.  The slide was 500 to 800 metres wide and travelled a kilometre down the slope. Some of the skiers were buried as deep as three metres, said Dunn. She said the group was carrying the proper avalanche-rescue equipment, including personal locator beacons and digging tools.  A park conditions bulletin said there was a considerable avalanche hazard in the area Saturday. That rating is about the middle of the hazard scale but includes the high probability that a person could trigger a slide, said Dunn.  "The risk always varies . . . when the risk is posted as considerable it's a note to skiers to be cautious," she said.  "There are a couple of instabilities in our snow pack this winter . . . that may have contributed and further investigation will determine (that)."  Saturday's slide was unusually deadly, said Eric Dafoe, public safety officer with Parks Canada in Revelstoke.  "We've never had an avalanche like this where we had a multiple number of people buried," said Dafoe, who worked on the rescue effort and flew over the slide as part the initial investigation.  "It was a huge slide," he said. "It covered the valley floor from side to side."  Dafoe said the slide began at a point between 2,200 to 2,300 vertical metres up Mount Cheops. It travelled for a kilometre and spread out half a kilometre at the sides.  The toe of the slide ended at about the 1,500-metre elevation mark with parts of it more than five metres deep.  Dafoe said the investigation will continue but was almost certain it was a natural slide.  "It (the slide trigger site) is so far from the bottom it seems unlikely it was human-triggered," he said.  Dafoe speculated a small slide may have occurred high up the mountain and as it came down, it dragged out snow from surrounding gullies.  Park wardens, RCMP officers and local ski tour operators and guides, backed up by four or five helicopters and search dogs, joined in the rescue effort.  Members of a Canadian Horse Artillery unit stationed in the park for avalanche-control work were also on hand to assist.  It was the second major slide in the area in a month.  Seven people in a party of 21 back-country skiers died in a much smaller avalanche Jan. 20 on Durrand Glacier, located about 30 kilometres east of Saturday's slide.  A memorial service for the victims was held just Friday in a Revelstoke church.  Ruedi Beglinger, owner of Selkirk Mountain Experience and organizer of the fatal expedition last month, was with his clients when it struck.  Contacted Saturday night, Beglinger did not want to comment on the level of experience necessary to ski the area where the students were caught.  "There is an inherent risk (in back-country skiing) which is very important to talk about, an inherent risk people have to be willing to share amongst themselves (whether) they have a guide or not," he said.  The area of Saturday's slide is not particularly remote, but Dunn said there were no groomed trails, "except people who have been there before you."  But no guides are needed to ski in the area and skiers do not have to register before setting off.  "It's a very, very popular ski destination site," said Dunn, media liaison officer at the national park.  Brown said the skiers were not part of a commercial tour group.  Doyle said that at this time there are no plans yet to close back-country areas of the park. UPDATE REVELSTOKE, B.C. (CP) - Authorities said Sunday it was time to take another look at the safety of back-country skiing in an area where a day earlier seven Calgary-area teens were swept to their deaths in a massive avalanche. Six boys and one girl were killed Saturday while skiing with a high-school group on Mount Cheops in Glacier National Park, about five kilometres west of the Rogers Pass summit in east-central British Columbia.  B.C. Premier Gordon Campbell said Sunday he wanted his government to work with federal officials and professional associations on a "comprehensive review" of safety in such wilderness expanses. "Obviously, all of us have to work together on this," said Campbell, who did not specify the scope he thought a review should take, or what role he thought the provincial government should assume. "None of us want this to happen to anyone who is enjoying our parks and our wilderness." Campbell offered few details on what changes might be proposed, saying it was important to "wait and get all the information that we ... need, to make sure the steps we take are steps that will move us down the right road."  Meanwhile, a Parks Canada official with the federal department's local avalanche control section said the current system for providing risk bulletins to back-country skiers in the park would be re-evaluated.  David Skjonsberg said the area where the teens died is under Parks Canada jurisdiction but the department doesn't "carry out any avalanche control for back-country areas of the park."  His office provides daily avalanche risk bulletins but "there is an expectation that the user make their own decision in terms of destinations, trip procedures and the type of equipment."  Skjonsberg said the avalanche warning system would be re-evaluated but thought it was "unlikely we're going to see any major changes in our approach.  "We believe we're providing a good quality product for back-country users," he said. "But perhaps there's something we're missing in how we convey the information to users so they really fully understand our definition of the danger ratings, for instance, and what the potential consequences of that danger rating might be."  He was hesitant to say whether the group composed of 14 students and three adult supervisors should have been skiing in the area at the time they were hit.  "At any time if you travel in mountains, there is always a risk," he said. "The probability of an avalanche is never zero."  Clair Israelson, director of the Canadian Avalanche Association in Revelstoke, said Sunday it was time "that B.C. and Alberta and Canada seriously address the avalanche safety issue in Western Canada."  He recommended that a coalition of industry, government and private sector workers work together to promote better warning systems.  Skjonsberg said he didn't foresee the long-term closure of the area where the avalanche occurred.  The area was reopened by Sunday night after being temporarily closed for investigators.  "If I was to close that area, I'm afraid I'd have to be looking at virtually closing off the back-country of the park and I really don't feel that's warranted," he said. "I think people can travel safely in the mountains."  The high-school group was hit just before noon by a massive slide that swept through the Connaught Creek Valley on Mount Cheops. The group included 14 students and three adult supervisors.  The tragedy was only about 30 kilometres away from the site of a smaller slide two weeks earlier that killed seven adult back-country skiers. That avalanche was termed a fluke of nature by one survivor and authorities said there was no evidence it was caused by the skiers themselves.  Saturday's slide travelled through the valley and into the shoulder where the party was climbing the valley, said Eric Dafoe, a public safety officer with Parks Canada in Revelstoke. It was about 500 metres wide and officials said it was capable of destroying a building.  Two nearby mountain guides witnessed the slide and had just managed to shout a warning when the slide hit.  Dafoe said the skiers had "somewhere between four and five seconds" before being swept away. The two guides rushed over and managed to dig out a supervisor whose hand was just visible through the snow. That supervisor immediately called park wardens on a satellite phone to raise the alarm. A rescue party was on scene within 40 minutes, but Dafoe said the students and supervisors initially rescued by the guides had already begun work on digging out their fellow skiers.  "People were searching the snow, digging," he said. As many as 35 people managed to get to the site to help with the rescue, said Dafoe. All but three people had been pulled out within 40 minutes. "It was a huge co-operative effort," he said. "It occurred very rapidly." The group's three adult supervisors and remaining seven students escaped with minor injuries. Those who died were asphyxiated, coroner Chuck Purse said Sunday.  Red-eyed teenagers and their parents began arriving early Sunday at Strathcona-Tweedsmuir School, a private school on an expansive campus in the foothills southwest of Calgary.  A team of grief counsellors began working with about 300 members of the shell-shocked school community.  Principal Glenn Odland said Sunday a third-party investigation would conduct an inquiry into the preparation that went into the trip, but said the three adult supervisors were well-prepared and had extensive training.  The avalanche risk for the alpine area above the students was classified as considerable by Skjonsberg's office that day, but the risk was only moderate in the treeline area where the students were skiing. But the avalanche travelled a kilometre, engulfing the teenagers and their supervisors. UPDATE: David Heyman  Calgary Herald  Monday, February 03, 2003 Skiers from Strathcona-Tweedsmuir High School had four or five seconds to react to a massive slide of snow powerful enough to take out buildings. The slide was so large it contained at least 1,000 tonnes of snow, according to information provided by the Canadian Avalanche Association.  "It was huge," said Eric Dafoe, public safety co-ordinator for Glacier National Park, who was on the scene shortly after the avalanche occurred. He rated the slide as a three or 3.5 on a scale of five. At that level, an avalanche can bury and destroy a car or small building and snap trees. An avalanche rated as one is relatively harmless to people, whereas an avalanche rated as five could destroy a village or a forest. Dafoe added the skiers would have had no time to get out of the avalanche's path. He said the slide fractured the snowpack at a depth of between 80 and 150 centimetres. It swept about a kilometre downhill and was about 500 to 800 metres wide, barrelling down the hill towards the 17 skiers.  Seven of the skiers died and all were Grade 10 students at the Okotoks-area school. The survivors included seven students, one parent chaperone and two teachers. The seeds of Saturday's avalanche were sown last November when a particularly unstable layer of snow was created at the beginning of a very unusual season. This layer has created problems throughout the season, but on Saturday, the instability turned into a massive avalanche. Last month, another avalanche swept down nearby Durrand Glacier, burying a group of backcountry skiers. Of the 13 people buried in that avalanche, seven people died.  Dave Skjonsberg, manager of the avalanche control section of Parks Canada, said Saturday's slide started well above the treeline where the avalanche risk was rated "considerable" but swept into the areas below where the risk was rated "moderate." "Although technically you could say they were at treeline, the avalanche did not start at treeline," he said. "The avalanche initiated in the alpine. It progressed below the treeline, and the results were tragic." He said the area around Revelstoke has had one of the most unusual snow seasons in the past 30 years and that's created very unstable sections in the snowpack, especially areas laid down in November, upon which newer snow has rested. An investigation has been launched into the cause of this avalanche. It started small at around 11:40 a.m. Saturday, high above the treeline on the west shoulder of the north face of Mount Cheops, about three kilometres from the Trans-Canada Highway. It was first spotted by two backcountry skiers from Golden, who were relaxing on the opposite side of the Connaught Valley. They had just passed the group of 14 students and three guides from Strathcona-Tweedsmuir School and knew, to their horror, they were in immediate peril. RCMP say one man shouted "Avalanche, avalanche, avalanche," but it was already too late. The small slide quickly dug into much deeper snow further down, pulling with it hundreds of tonnes of snow. The entire mass quickly accelerated down the mountain in a plume of mist and debris. Such was its speed and force that it swept around a corner, part way up another mountain before flushing down the Balu Pass Trail where the students were, burying all 17 skiers. Clair Israelson, managing director of the Canadian Avalanche Association in Revelstoke, said the avalanche "moved extremely quickly. The people involved had very little chance to do anything prior to being hit by the snow.  "This was a large avalanche. This would have been big enough to destroy your home or a train." UPDATE: REVELSTOKE, B.C. -- "Avalanche, avalanche, avalanche!!" A shout from a fellow skier was the only warning a group of 14 students and three adults from the Calgary area had on Saturday. Five seconds later, a huge wall of snow crashed down on the skiers, burying some as deep as four metres. A frantic rescue attempt followed, with survivors making heroic efforts to save their classmates. People pulled from the snow immediately dug out others still below. One student brushed the snow from a classmate's mouth and tried mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. In the end, seven teenagers -- six boys and a girl -- died. Their day had started routinely. The students and their instructors from Strathcona-Tweedsmuir School near Calgary set out early Saturday on the annual Grade 10 backcountry ski trip to Glacier National Park, west of Banff. Overnight snowfall had added to the light-but-steady accumulation on the mountains around Rogers Pass. The temperature was around 0. Warm southwesterly winds blew across their trail as they left the parking lot at Connaught Creek. Parks Canada had warned that avalanches were possible in the higher alpine areas but were unlikely below the tree line, where the group was skiing. Just before noon, the avalanche started as a small snow slide, high on Cheops Mountain. It grew steadily as it barrelled down. It was a rolling wall of snow one kilometre long and 500 to 800 metres wide by the time it thundered into the valley and pushed up the far side with enough force to wipe out a building. A skier near the school group saw the slide and screamed "avalanche" three times as the group moved along a trail, about three kilometres from the parking lot, not far above the valley floor. Five seconds later, the group was under snow -- some four metres down. The 10 survivors were saved by the intensive efforts of a rescue team of 35 people, including Armed Forces personnel. Sergeant Randy Brown of the Revelstoke RCMP detachment said two experienced backcountry skiers saw the avalanche and realized a group of skiers was caught in it. The rescue team, which arrived at the scene 45 minutes after receiving the call for help, included seven helicopters, local ski guides, six avalanche search dogs, park wardens, ski patrols and members of the Forces who normally deal with avalanche control at Rogers Pass. It took one hour and 20 minutes to find the entire group. Coroner Chuck Purse said the seven students died of asphyxiation. After reviewing reports by the RCMP and a consultant, he will decide whether to hold an inquest into the backcountry deaths. Dave Skjonsberg, manager of Parks Canada's avalanche-control section in Revelstoke, said the region's weather was highly unusual. The mountains have had little snow. "It is one of the most unusual winters in 30 years." Survivors were airlifted out of the park and brought to Revelstoke, about 65 kilometres west of Glacier National Park.With swollen, red eyes, the parents -- along with the survivors' siblings -- accompanied the children yesterday. Some of the students, with bruises on their faces, could be seen boarding a bus. One student has a serious leg injury. Several family members, appearing stunned, declined comment.The deaths come two weeks after an avalanche killed seven skiers in the same region of British Columbia. This winter, 16 people have died in B.C. avalanches. An average of 13 people die in Canadian avalanches annually. Parks Canada, the B.C. Coroner's Office, the RCMP and the school announced investigations to discover what had happened and whether anyone could have done anything differently. School principal Glenn Odland said the skiers were highly skilled and well-equipped. The group leader was a certified backcountry guide, and the other adults were trained and experienced, he said. The elite private school, about 20 minutes south of Calgary, offers six trips a year for students to experience the backcountry. UPDATE: "By the time they wake Saturday morning, Parks Canada has already posted its avalanche bulletin for backcountry skiers. In tree-line and alpine areas, the avalanche risk has been assessed as "considerable," the mid-range of the five possible ratings. Below the tree line, the risk is assessed as "moderate," with natural avalanches unlikely. And the STS group intends to stay below the tree line throughout its telemark expedition to Balu Pass. But the bulletin also refers to weak snow layers left over from early winter snowfalls that have failed to stabilize. There were similar references for the same mountain range in avalanche bulletins last month, just before the deadly slide that claimed seven lives near Revelstoke, B.C.The group makes its way to the Rogers Pass information building, a macaroni-shaped structure with a sod and timber roof, to pore over the latest information. Mr. Nicholson goes inside. He asks about conditions in several areas before heading back to the students and two other adults -- a fellow teacher and a chaperone. The group decides it is safe to ski that day. By 10:15 a.m., they are on the trailhead to the pass, five kilometres away, described by backcountry enthusiasts as an easy, but beautiful trail. They ski through forest, along a rocky creek, over a snow-covered bridge and into the Connaught Creek valley. Surrounded by mountains and deep powder snow, the scenery is breathtaking. Reminders of past avalanches are everywhere. Relentless slides tearing down either side of the valley over the years have littered the area with rocks and stumps. Foliage is sparse on the valley floor. The school group successfully crosses four avalanche-prone paths on the north side of the valley, and three on the south side. They note that the debris from one avalanche path across the valley is no more than a week old. They are halfway to their destination. ***   It's a soft, grey morning. The ground is blanketed by eight centimetres of fresh snow. The temperature hovers around zero. The past 24 hours have been avalanche-free, and Abby Watkins and Rich Marshall are eager to get in a day of backcountry skiing amid the mountainous sweep near the summit of Rogers Pass in eastern British Columbia. They are not alone. The mountain guides spot a school group getting ready to press ahead into the popular Balu Pass. Husband and wife pause to say hello. "It's a beautiful day out here, isn't it?" says Abby. "Yes," someone responds. They leave the 14 teenagers and three adults behind, climbing briskly until they stop for a break in a treed area.   Abby looks back at the people below and a gangly teen, all arms and legs, catches her eye. "Aren't kids funny? Look at that kid," she tells Rich. At that very moment, just before noon on Saturday, something gives way on the rugged north face of Cheops Mountain. Abby and Rich hear a thunderous roar. They watch in horror as a torrent of snow hurtles to the valley, picking up speed and debris. The school group is directly in its path. Rich screams: "Avalanche! Avalanche! Avalanche!" The skiers look up. The guide's frantic warning comes too late. The avalanche hits them head on. In a matter of seconds, all 17 skiers are swept away in a huge, terrifying tangle of snow, rocks and trees. The swiftness and power of the avalanche sounds like a freight train moving at high speeds, Abby thinks. "A huge roar. The power of that much snow moving at the acceleration of gravity and propagating more and more snow on the way. . . . Nobody could have got out of the way. Nobody." The river-rush of snow engulfs the skiers, then separates them. A section of the slide breaks away and keeps going, carrying a number of victims hundreds of metres down the valley. Disoriented and tumbling head over foot with little chance to "swim" to the surface, this unlucky group ends up as much as 4.5 metres beneath the concrete-hard snow. Up in the trees, Abby Watkins and Rich  Marshall are dusted by a thick cloud of powder. A terrible silence falls over the valley. Though their hearts are thumping, they shut down their emotions. On goes the search-and-rescue switch, one they have trained for years to put into practice. They race down to the first group of buried skiers. The only sign of life is an odd hand and a few legs poking through the snow. The others, in the toe of the slide at the bottom of the valley, are buried much deeper. Alone at the scene, the husband-and-wife team is faced with heartbreaking decisions. Who to save first? Not everybody would make it, they reason. But those trapped near the top would have a better shot at survival. Rich runs for the first hand he sees and begins digging. It's A.N.. He finds Mr. N's shovel so the group leader can dig himself out, and moves on. A.N. has a satellite phone and calls for help. But for the next 45 minutes, except for the victims, Rich and Abby are there by themselves, working to free as many as they can from their tombs of suffocating snow. The guides' transceivers work perfectly, honing in with beeps and flashing lights on the buried skiers equipped with their own avalanche beacons, like shouts from the grave. The couple follows the rules of avalanche rescue like clockwork. Only dig to a victim to make sure he or she is breathing. Clear snow from the victim's face. No CPR before moving on to the next victim. There are too many. Let survivors dig themselves out. Once free, the numb and distraught living do their best to help. The victims are scattered beneath the snow. Rich and Abby split up to cover as much ground as possible. The first five people they pull out survive. Those survivors go on to rescue others. Everyone else Abby and Rich uncover is dead. The grim lottery of who shall live and who shall die is over. Seven students make it. Seven do not. An hour after the avalanche, seven helicopters, three dogs and more than 30 individuals are on site. By 1:30 p.m., the final victim has been dug out. One survivor, with a broken ankle, is tobogganed out and airlifted to hospital. The remaining survivors are transported by helicopter to the cafeteria of the park warden's station. The bodies go, too. They are laid out on mats in a makeshift morgue in the same building. Chuck Purse, Revelstoke's part-time coroner, is investigating his second seven-death avalanche within two weeks. He examines each body in turn. None show signs of major injury. They were simply swept away and buried, dying from asphyxiation.  On Saturday, Feb. 1, 14 Grade 10 students from Strathcona-Tweedsmuir School south of Calgary, set out on a backcountry ski trip up the Balu Pass in Glacier National Park, B.C. At around 11:45 a.m., they were caught in an avalanche that killed seven of them. Here is the sequence of events on that day. 1. Before departing, the leaders checked with the National Park staff for current avalanche conditions. They were advised that the threat of avalanches was moderate below the tree line and considerable above it. Students were equipped with personal avalanche beacons, probes and shovels. At 8:40 a.m., students left A.O. Wheeler Hut by van and headed to Rogers Pass Information Centre, where they conducted at least one test for avalanche risk. 2. 10:15 a.m.: Commencement of trip up the Balu Pass trail. Following standard procedure, the one teacher led and the other adult leaders followed at the rear of the skiers, who were 15 metres from each other. 3. 11:45 a.m.: About halfway up the valley, an avalanche slid off the ridge of Cheops Mountain burying the group. Two skiers about 200 metres ahead helped rescue the teacher in the lead who contacted wardens by satellite phone.  12:30 p.m.: Six students were reported alive. 12:45 p.m.: Wardens arrive. 4. 1:30 p.m.: All students were accounted for, including the seven who lost their lives. 1.45 p.m.: One of the students was tobogganed back to the motel with a broken ankle. Meanwhile, helicopters joined the rescue and airlifted students to the motel parking lot, from where they were transported to a private home in Revelstoke.  How the avalanche happened:  A small slide began high up on the ridge of Cheops Mountain, above the south side of Connaught Creek Valley. This set off a huge second slide that crashed into the valley bottom with such force that it rode high up the opposite wall as it was redirected eastward down the valley, burying the group of skiers.Analysis: Jan 31-03 Avalanche Bulletin for the: NORTH COLUMBIA REGION WEATHER: The past week has seen light to moderate snowfall at relativelywarm temperatures accompanied by moderate south westerly winds. Freezing levels were around 1000 m on Friday and were forecast to lower to valley bottom by the end of the weekend. As the flow turns more north westerly this weekend, weather forecasters predict continuing light to moderate precipitation through Sunday, accompanied by moderate NW winds. SNOWPACK: Last weekends warm precipitation event produced a substantial crust up to about 2100 m when temperatures dropped. Wind slabs from 20 to 40 cm thick have formed above this layer from treeline up into the alpine, mostly on North and East aspects. Subtle weak layers within this recent storm snow are a concern heading into this weekend, as wind and continuing precipitation will continue to add to the load. A series of buried surface hoar weaknesses in the upper two metres will also come under increasing tension as loading increases. AVALANCHES: Significant avalanche activity earlier in the week has tapered off, although isolated human triggered thin slabs were still being reported on Thursday. With continuing wind and snowfall this weekend, it will still be possible to trigger avalanches in wind loaded areas near treeline and above. FORECAST OF AVALANCHE DANGER UP TO MONDAY EVENING (FEBRUARY 3)ALPINE - Considerable TREELINE - Considerable BELOW TREELINE  Moderate  TRAVEL ADVISORY: Watch for areas of significant wind loading at allelevations and take note of any signs of instability such as cracking and whumpfing. Cornices will have weakened with the warm weather. If they fall they can easily trigger avalanches on the slopes below, so keep an eye peeled to slopes above whenever visibility allows.   UPDATE: B.C. Solicitor General Rich Coleman said he's considering emergency funding for an avalanche bulletin to be published every day. Currently, the warning is published three times a week.  Coleman said he may be able to announce funding later this week that would allow the bulletin to be published for the rest of the season. The government had previously cut funding by $17,000 for this year.  But no matter how much information is available, some people will still decide the risk is worth the back-country experience, Coleman said.  He said the government will consider ways of lowering the risk, but no one can ever eliminate it entirely.  Coleman said it would be like closing highways to stop car accidents. UPDATE: Snow scientist Bruce Jamieson, author of numerous books on avalanches, noted that government funding of avalanche awareness in Canada accounts for only 10 per cent to 12 per cent of the total amount spent. That compares with 50 per cent in the United States and nearly 100 per cent in Europe, he said. The British Columbia government, which withdrew a large chunk of funding last year from a critical avalanche-warning bulletin, is now considering increasing its share of the costs to allow the bulletin to appear every day during high-risk periods. UPDATE: Sunday, February 09, 2003 The B.C. government has agreed to pay for more frequent avalanche warning bulletins, after two deadly slides that killed 14 people in eastern B.C. in the past month. Solicitor-General Rich Coleman told an open cabinet meeting Friday the province will pay for a series of "extraordinary bulletins" warning backcountry travellers of elevated avalanche risks. "It will raise one more level of awareness," Mr. Coleman said, but added it won't eliminate death.  The commitment is less than what the Canadian Avalanche Association in Revelstoke, B.C., had hoped for. It wanted enough money for daily bulletins. The association currently produces three bulletins a week during the winter. Under the new funding arrangement, if something significantly changes between those bulletins -- such as freezing rain, severe temperature variations or increased avalanche activity -- the provincial cash will provide for additional bulletins. The number of special bulletins will be determined by the weather, but a government spokesman estimated there could be six over the remainder of the season, meaning an expenditure of an extra $15,000. Mr. Coleman said the entire process of issuing a special bulletin will take no more than three or four hours. Seven Alberta high school students died in an avalanche on Feb. 1, while seven adult skiers were killed in a slide on Jan. 20. Both avalanches occurred near Revelstoke. The B.C. government pulled out of its funding arrangement with the association in 2001. Until that time the province had covered half the $82,000 cost to produce three bulletins a week. The association has been able to continue producing bulletins by raising money in the private sector. A seven-day-a-week bulletin in winter would cost $250,000.Rescue Mode: helicopterInjuries: fatalitiesSource: Canadian Press, Globe and MailContributing Cause(s): AVALANCHETopCopyright 2001 - 2002, The Alpine Club of Canada.

Cheops, Feb. 1-03Photo by: Canadian Press / RCMPDescription: Sunday, February 02, 2003  REVELSTOKE, B.C. -- Seven teens on a high-school ski excursion in the treacherous back country of east-central B.C. died Saturday when a half-kilometre-wide avalanche roared down from a mountainside and engulfed their group.  It was the second deadly slide to hit the region in as many weeks. Seven adults perished in a slide in January. The dead were six boys and one girl, all in Grade 10 at Strathcona-Tweedsmuir School, a private day school on an expansive rural campus in the foothills southwest of Calgary.  The surviving students, the two teachers and parent chaperone were expected back in Calgary late Sunday night. Six of the students have some scrapes and bruises, and one male suffered a broken ankle. "We are absolutely stricken with grief. Our hearts go out to all those who are impacted," Tony Macoun, head of the school, said in a written statement.  Frantic parents gathered at the school Saturday night, arriving separately and in groups, embracing each other. No students were visible.  "Our school is a small family and loss this extreme is impacting us tremendously," said Macoun.  There were 17 people in the school group, three adults and 14 Grade 10 students in an outdoor education class, on their annual cross-country ski trip.  The avalanche occurred on Mount Cheops in Glacier National Park just before noon, said Pam Doyle, superintendent for Parks Canada in Revelstoke.  It happened on the north face of the mountain in Connaught Creek Valley section of Balu Valley, about five kilometres west of the Rogers Pass summit.  The group was led by two male teachers and a male volunteer. All had certification and back-country experience, Macoun said. The group had been skiing about 15 metres apart, with one supervisor in front and the other two bringing up the rear.  The skiers were halfway up the valley when the avalanche roared down the north slope, burying nearly the entire group.  Another group of young skiers witnessed the avalanche and were among the first to help.  A supervisor whose hand was just visible above the snow was the first to be dug out. Once freed, he called park wardens on a satellite phone to raise the alarm.  "Of the remaining students, six of the students are safe and one has a broken ankle," Macoun said in his statement.  The three leaders were uninjured and are attending to the survivors, who were in Revelstoke on Saturday night after being airlifted first to Glacier Park Lodge by helicopter.  Two people from the group were treated for minor injuries, said RCMP Sgt. Randy Brown.  The avalanche was "very powerful," with a rating from 3 to 3.5, compared with a top rating of 4, said Pat Dunn, a Parks Canada spokeswoman.  "The size 3 to 3.5 avalanche could destroy a building . . . or 10 acres of forest," she said.  The slide was 500 to 800 metres wide and travelled a kilometre down the slope. Some of the skiers were buried as deep as three metres, said Dunn. She said the group was carrying the proper avalanche-rescue equipment, including personal locator beacons and digging tools.  A park conditions bulletin said there was a considerable avalanche hazard in the area Saturday. That rating is about the middle of the hazard scale but includes the high probability that a person could trigger a slide, said Dunn.  "The risk always varies . . . when the risk is posted as considerable it's a note to skiers to be cautious," she said.  "There are a couple of instabilities in our snow pack this winter . . . that may have contributed and further investigation will determine (that)."  Saturday's slide was unusually deadly, said Eric Dafoe, public safety officer with Parks Canada in Revelstoke.  "We've never had an avalanche like this where we had a multiple number of people buried," said Dafoe, who worked on the rescue effort and flew over the slide as part the initial investigation.  "It was a huge slide," he said. "It covered the valley floor from side to side."  Dafoe said the slide began at a point between 2,200 to 2,300 vertical metres up Mount Cheops. It travelled for a kilometre and spread out half a kilometre at the sides.  The toe of the slide ended at about the 1,500-metre elevation mark with parts of it more than five metres deep.  Dafoe said the investigation will continue but was almost certain it was a natural slide.  "It (the slide trigger site) is so far from the bottom it seems unlikely it was human-triggered," he said.  Dafoe speculated a small slide may have occurred high up the mountain and as it came down, it dragged out snow from surrounding gullies.  Park wardens, RCMP officers and local ski tour operators and guides, backed up by four or five helicopters and search dogs, joined in the rescue effort.  Members of a Canadian Horse Artillery unit stationed in the park for avalanche-control work were also on hand to assist.  It was the second major slide in the area in a month.  Seven people in a party of 21 back-country skiers died in a much smaller avalanche Jan. 20 on Durrand Glacier, located about 30 kilometres east of Saturday's slide.  A memorial service for the victims was held just Friday in a Revelstoke church.  Ruedi Beglinger, owner of Selkirk Mountain Experience and organizer of the fatal expedition last month, was with his clients when it struck.  Contacted Saturday night, Beglinger did not want to comment on the level of experience necessary to ski the area where the students were caught.  "There is an inherent risk (in back-country skiing) which is very important to talk about, an inherent risk people have to be willing to share amongst themselves (whether) they have a guide or not," he said.  The area of Saturday's slide is not particularly remote, but Dunn said there were no groomed trails, "except people who have been there before you."  But no guides are needed to ski in the area and skiers do not have to register before setting off.  "It's a very, very popular ski destination site," said Dunn, media liaison officer at the national park.  Brown said the skiers were not part of a commercial tour group.  Doyle said that at this time there are no plans yet to close back-country areas of the park. UPDATE REVELSTOKE, B.C. (CP) - Authorities said Sunday it was time to take another look at the safety of back-country skiing in an area where a day earlier seven Calgary-area teens were swept to their deaths in a massive avalanche. Six boys and one girl were killed Saturday while skiing with a high-school group on Mount Cheops in Glacier National Park, about five kilometres west of the Rogers Pass summit in east-central British Columbia.  B.C. Premier Gordon Campbell said Sunday he wanted his government to work with federal officials and professional associations on a "comprehensive review" of safety in such wilderness expanses. "Obviously, all of us have to work together on this," said Campbell, who did not specify the scope he thought a review should take, or what role he thought the provincial government should assume. "None of us want this to happen to anyone who is enjoying our parks and our wilderness." Campbell offered few details on what changes might be proposed, saying it was important to "wait and get all the information that we ... need, to make sure the steps we take are steps that will move us down the right road."  Meanwhile, a Parks Canada official with the federal department's local avalanche control section said the current system for providing risk bulletins to back-country skiers in the park would be re-evaluated.  David Skjonsberg said the area where the teens died is under Parks Canada jurisdiction but the department doesn't "carry out any avalanche control for back-country areas of the park."  His office provides daily avalanche risk bulletins but "there is an expectation that the user make their own decision in terms of destinations, trip procedures and the type of equipment."  Skjonsberg said the avalanche warning system would be re-evaluated but thought it was "unlikely we're going to see any major changes in our approach.  "We believe we're providing a good quality product for back-country users," he said. "But perhaps there's something we're missing in how we convey the information to users so they really fully understand our definition of the danger ratings, for instance, and what the potential consequences of that danger rating might be."  He was hesitant to say whether the group composed of 14 students and three adult supervisors should have been skiing in the area at the time they were hit.  "At any time if you travel in mountains, there is always a risk," he said. "The probability of an avalanche is never zero."  Clair Israelson, director of the Canadian Avalanche Association in Revelstoke, said Sunday it was time "that B.C. and Alberta and Canada seriously address the avalanche safety issue in Western Canada."  He recommended that a coalition of industry, government and private sector workers work together to promote better warning systems.  Skjonsberg said he didn't foresee the long-term closure of the area where the avalanche occurred.  The area was reopened by Sunday night after being temporarily closed for investigators.  "If I was to close that area, I'm afraid I'd have to be looking at virtually closing off the back-country of the park and I really don't feel that's warranted," he said. "I think people can travel safely in the mountains."  The high-school group was hit just before noon by a massive slide that swept through the Connaught Creek Valley on Mount Cheops. The group included 14 students and three adult supervisors.  The tragedy was only about 30 kilometres away from the site of a smaller slide two weeks earlier that killed seven adult back-country skiers. That avalanche was termed a fluke of nature by one survivor and authorities said there was no evidence it was caused by the skiers themselves.  Saturday's slide travelled through the valley and into the shoulder where the party was climbing the valley, said Eric Dafoe, a public safety officer with Parks Canada in Revelstoke. It was about 500 metres wide and officials said it was capable of destroying a building.  Two nearby mountain guides witnessed the slide and had just managed to shout a warning when the slide hit.  Dafoe said the skiers had "somewhere between four and five seconds" before being swept away. The two guides rushed over and managed to dig out a supervisor whose hand was just visible through the snow. That supervisor immediately called park wardens on a satellite phone to raise the alarm. A rescue party was on scene within 40 minutes, but Dafoe said the students and supervisors initially rescued by the guides had already begun work on digging out their fellow skiers.  "People were searching the snow, digging," he said. As many as 35 people managed to get to the site to help with the rescue, said Dafoe. All but three people had been pulled out within 40 minutes. "It was a huge co-operative effort," he said. "It occurred very rapidly." The group's three adult supervisors and remaining seven students escaped with minor injuries. Those who died were asphyxiated, coroner Chuck Purse said Sunday.  Red-eyed teenagers and their parents began arriving early Sunday at Strathcona-Tweedsmuir School, a private school on an expansive campus in the foothills southwest of Calgary.  A team of grief counsellors began working with about 300 members of the shell-shocked school community.  Principal Glenn Odland said Sunday a third-party investigation would conduct an inquiry into the preparation that went into the trip, but said the three adult supervisors were well-prepared and had extensive training.  The avalanche risk for the alpine area above the students was classified as considerable by Skjonsberg's office that day, but the risk was only moderate in the treeline area where the students were skiing. But the avalanche travelled a kilometre, engulfing the teenagers and their supervisors. UPDATE: David Heyman  Calgary Herald  Monday, February 03, 2003 Skiers from Strathcona-Tweedsmuir High School had four or five seconds to react to a massive slide of snow powerful enough to take out buildings. The slide was so large it contained at least 1,000 tonnes of snow, according to information provided by the Canadian Avalanche Association.  "It was huge," said Eric Dafoe, public safety co-ordinator for Glacier National Park, who was on the scene shortly after the avalanche occurred. He rated the slide as a three or 3.5 on a scale of five. At that level, an avalanche can bury and destroy a car or small building and snap trees. An avalanche rated as one is relatively harmless to people, whereas an avalanche rated as five could destroy a village or a forest. Dafoe added the skiers would have had no time to get out of the avalanche's path. He said the slide fractured the snowpack at a depth of between 80 and 150 centimetres. It swept about a kilometre downhill and was about 500 to 800 metres wide, barrelling down the hill towards the 17 skiers.  Seven of the skiers died and all were Grade 10 students at the Okotoks-area school. The survivors included seven students, one parent chaperone and two teachers. The seeds of Saturday's avalanche were sown last November when a particularly unstable layer of snow was created at the beginning of a very unusual season. This layer has created problems throughout the season, but on Saturday, the instability turned into a massive avalanche. Last month, another avalanche swept down nearby Durrand Glacier, burying a group of backcountry skiers. Of the 13 people buried in that avalanche, seven people died.  Dave Skjonsberg, manager of the avalanche control section of Parks Canada, said Saturday's slide started well above the treeline where the avalanche risk was rated "considerable" but swept into the areas below where the risk was rated "moderate." "Although technically you could say they were at treeline, the avalanche did not start at treeline," he said. "The avalanche initiated in the alpine. It progressed below the treeline, and the results were tragic." He said the area around Revelstoke has had one of the most unusual snow seasons in the past 30 years and that's created very unstable sections in the snowpack, especially areas laid down in November, upon which newer snow has rested. An investigation has been launched into the cause of this avalanche. It started small at around 11:40 a.m. Saturday, high above the treeline on the west shoulder of the north face of Mount Cheops, about three kilometres from the Trans-Canada Highway. It was first spotted by two backcountry skiers from Golden, who were relaxing on the opposite side of the Connaught Valley. They had just passed the group of 14 students and three guides from Strathcona-Tweedsmuir School and knew, to their horror, they were in immediate peril. RCMP say one man shouted "Avalanche, avalanche, avalanche," but it was already too late. The small slide quickly dug into much deeper snow further down, pulling with it hundreds of tonnes of snow. The entire mass quickly accelerated down the mountain in a plume of mist and debris. Such was its speed and force that it swept around a corner, part way up another mountain before flushing down the Balu Pass Trail where the students were, burying all 17 skiers. Clair Israelson, managing director of the Canadian Avalanche Association in Revelstoke, said the avalanche "moved extremely quickly. The people involved had very little chance to do anything prior to being hit by the snow.  "This was a large avalanche. This would have been big enough to destroy your home or a train." UPDATE: REVELSTOKE, B.C. -- "Avalanche, avalanche, avalanche!!" A shout from a fellow skier was the only warning a group of 14 students and three adults from the Calgary area had on Saturday. Five seconds later, a huge wall of snow crashed down on the skiers, burying some as deep as four metres. A frantic rescue attempt followed, with survivors making heroic efforts to save their classmates. People pulled from the snow immediately dug out others still below. One student brushed the snow from a classmate's mouth and tried mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. In the end, seven teenagers -- six boys and a girl -- died. Their day had started routinely. The students and their instructors from Strathcona-Tweedsmuir School near Calgary set out early Saturday on the annual Grade 10 backcountry ski trip to Glacier National Park, west of Banff. Overnight snowfall had added to the light-but-steady accumulation on the mountains around Rogers Pass. The temperature was around 0. Warm southwesterly winds blew across their trail as they left the parking lot at Connaught Creek. Parks Canada had warned that avalanches were possible in the higher alpine areas but were unlikely below the tree line, where the group was skiing. Just before noon, the avalanche started as a small snow slide, high on Cheops Mountain. It grew steadily as it barrelled down. It was a rolling wall of snow one kilometre long and 500 to 800 metres wide by the time it thundered into the valley and pushed up the far side with enough force to wipe out a building. A skier near the school group saw the slide and screamed "avalanche" three times as the group moved along a trail, about three kilometres from the parking lot, not far above the valley floor. Five seconds later, the group was under snow -- some four metres down. The 10 survivors were saved by the intensive efforts of a rescue team of 35 people, including Armed Forces personnel. Sergeant Randy Brown of the Revelstoke RCMP detachment said two experienced backcountry skiers saw the avalanche and realized a group of skiers was caught in it. The rescue team, which arrived at the scene 45 minutes after receiving the call for help, included seven helicopters, local ski guides, six avalanche search dogs, park wardens, ski patrols and members of the Forces who normally deal with avalanche control at Rogers Pass. It took one hour and 20 minutes to find the entire group. Coroner Chuck Purse said the seven students died of asphyxiation. After reviewing reports by the RCMP and a consultant, he will decide whether to hold an inquest into the backcountry deaths. Dave Skjonsberg, manager of Parks Canada's avalanche-control section in Revelstoke, said the region's weather was highly unusual. The mountains have had little snow. "It is one of the most unusual winters in 30 years." Survivors were airlifted out of the park and brought to Revelstoke, about 65 kilometres west of Glacier National Park.With swollen, red eyes, the parents -- along with the survivors' siblings -- accompanied the children yesterday. Some of the students, with bruises on their faces, could be seen boarding a bus. One student has a serious leg injury. Several family members, appearing stunned, declined comment.The deaths come two weeks after an avalanche killed seven skiers in the same region of British Columbia. This winter, 16 people have died in B.C. avalanches. An average of 13 people die in Canadian avalanches annually. Parks Canada, the B.C. Coroner's Office, the RCMP and the school announced investigations to discover what had happened and whether anyone could have done anything differently. School principal Glenn Odland said the skiers were highly skilled and well-equipped. The group leader was a certified backcountry guide, and the other adults were trained and experienced, he said. The elite private school, about 20 minutes south of Calgary, offers six trips a year for students to experience the backcountry. UPDATE: "By the time they wake Saturday morning, Parks Canada has already posted its avalanche bulletin for backcountry skiers. In tree-line and alpine areas, the avalanche risk has been assessed as "considerable," the mid-range of the five possible ratings. Below the tree line, the risk is assessed as "moderate," with natural avalanches unlikely. And the STS group intends to stay below the tree line throughout its telemark expedition to Balu Pass. But the bulletin also refers to weak snow layers left over from early winter snowfalls that have failed to stabilize. There were similar references for the same mountain range in avalanche bulletins last month, just before the deadly slide that claimed seven lives near Revelstoke, B.C.The group makes its way to the Rogers Pass information building, a macaroni-shaped structure with a sod and timber roof, to pore over the latest information. Mr. Nicholson goes inside. He asks about conditions in several areas before heading back to the students and two other adults -- a fellow teacher and a chaperone. The group decides it is safe to ski that day. By 10:15 a.m., they are on the trailhead to the pass, five kilometres away, described by backcountry enthusiasts as an easy, but beautiful trail. They ski through forest, along a rocky creek, over a snow-covered bridge and into the Connaught Creek valley. Surrounded by mountains and deep powder snow, the scenery is breathtaking. Reminders of past avalanches are everywhere. Relentless slides tearing down either side of the valley over the years have littered the area with rocks and stumps. Foliage is sparse on the valley floor. The school group successfully crosses four avalanche-prone paths on the north side of the valley, and three on the south side. They note that the debris from one avalanche path across the valley is no more than a week old. They are halfway to their destination. ***   It's a soft, grey morning. The ground is blanketed by eight centimetres of fresh snow. The temperature hovers around zero. The past 24 hours have been avalanche-free, and Abby Watkins and Rich Marshall are eager to get in a day of backcountry skiing amid the mountainous sweep near the summit of Rogers Pass in eastern British Columbia. They are not alone. The mountain guides spot a school group getting ready to press ahead into the popular Balu Pass. Husband and wife pause to say hello. "It's a beautiful day out here, isn't it?" says Abby. "Yes," someone responds. They leave the 14 teenagers and three adults behind, climbing briskly until they stop for a break in a treed area.   Abby looks back at the people below and a gangly teen, all arms and legs, catches her eye. "Aren't kids funny? Look at that kid," she tells Rich. At that very moment, just before noon on Saturday, something gives way on the rugged north face of Cheops Mountain. Abby and Rich hear a thunderous roar. They watch in horror as a torrent of snow hurtles to the valley, picking up speed and debris. The school group is directly in its path. Rich screams: "Avalanche! Avalanche! Avalanche!" The skiers look up. The guide's frantic warning comes too late. The avalanche hits them head on. In a matter of seconds, all 17 skiers are swept away in a huge, terrifying tangle of snow, rocks and trees. The swiftness and power of the avalanche sounds like a freight train moving at high speeds, Abby thinks. "A huge roar. The power of that much snow moving at the acceleration of gravity and propagating more and more snow on the way. . . . Nobody could have got out of the way. Nobody." The river-rush of snow engulfs the skiers, then separates them. A section of the slide breaks away and keeps going, carrying a number of victims hundreds of metres down the valley. Disoriented and tumbling head over foot with little chance to "swim" to the surface, this unlucky group ends up as much as 4.5 metres beneath the concrete-hard snow. Up in the trees, Abby Watkins and Rich  Marshall are dusted by a thick cloud of powder. A terrible silence falls over the valley. Though their hearts are thumping, they shut down their emotions. On goes the search-and-rescue switch, one they have trained for years to put into practice. They race down to the first group of buried skiers. The only sign of life is an odd hand and a few legs poking through the snow. The others, in the toe of the slide at the bottom of the valley, are buried much deeper. Alone at the scene, the husband-and-wife team is faced with heartbreaking decisions. Who to save first? Not everybody would make it, they reason. But those trapped near the top would have a better shot at survival. Rich runs for the first hand he sees and begins digging. It's A.N.. He finds Mr. N's shovel so the group leader can dig himself out, and moves on. A.N. has a satellite phone and calls for help. But for the next 45 minutes, except for the victims, Rich and Abby are there by themselves, working to free as many as they can from their tombs of suffocating snow. The guides' transceivers work perfectly, honing in with beeps and flashing lights on the buried skiers equipped with their own avalanche beacons, like shouts from the grave. The couple follows the rules of avalanche rescue like clockwork. Only dig to a victim to make sure he or she is breathing. Clear snow from the victim's face. No CPR before moving on to the next victim. There are too many. Let survivors dig themselves out. Once free, the numb and distraught living do their best to help. The victims are scattered beneath the snow. Rich and Abby split up to cover as much ground as possible. The first five people they pull out survive. Those survivors go on to rescue others. Everyone else Abby and Rich uncover is dead. The grim lottery of who shall live and who shall die is over. Seven students make it. Seven do not. An hour after the avalanche, seven helicopters, three dogs and more than 30 individuals are on site. By 1:30 p.m., the final victim has been dug out. One survivor, with a broken ankle, is tobogganed out and airlifted to hospital. The remaining survivors are transported by helicopter to the cafeteria of the park warden's station. The bodies go, too. They are laid out on mats in a makeshift morgue in the same building. Chuck Purse, Revelstoke's part-time coroner, is investigating his second seven-death avalanche within two weeks. He examines each body in turn. None show signs of major injury. They were simply swept away and buried, dying from asphyxiation.  On Saturday, Feb. 1, 14 Grade 10 students from Strathcona-Tweedsmuir School south of Calgary, set out on a backcountry ski trip up the Balu Pass in Glacier National Park, B.C. At around 11:45 a.m., they were caught in an avalanche that killed seven of them. Here is the sequence of events on that day. 1. Before departing, the leaders checked with the National Park staff for current avalanche conditions. They were advised that the threat of avalanches was moderate below the tree line and considerable above it. Students were equipped with personal avalanche beacons, probes and shovels. At 8:40 a.m., students left A.O. Wheeler Hut by van and headed to Rogers Pass Information Centre, where they conducted at least one test for avalanche risk. 2. 10:15 a.m.: Commencement of trip up the Balu Pass trail. Following standard procedure, the one teacher led and the other adult leaders followed at the rear of the skiers, who were 15 metres from each other. 3. 11:45 a.m.: About halfway up the valley, an avalanche slid off the ridge of Cheops Mountain burying the group. Two skiers about 200 metres ahead helped rescue the teacher in the lead who contacted wardens by satellite phone.  12:30 p.m.: Six students were reported alive. 12:45 p.m.: Wardens arrive. 4. 1:30 p.m.: All students were accounted for, including the seven who lost their lives. 1.45 p.m.: One of the students was tobogganed back to the motel with a broken ankle. Meanwhile, helicopters joined the rescue and airlifted students to the motel parking lot, from where they were transported to a private home in Revelstoke.  How the avalanche happened:  A small slide began high up on the ridge of Cheops Mountain, above the south side of Connaught Creek Valley. This set off a huge second slide that crashed into the valley bottom with such force that it rode high up the opposite wall as it was redirected eastward down the valley, burying the group of skiers.Analysis: Jan 31-03 Avalanche Bulletin for the: NORTH COLUMBIA REGION WEATHER: The past week has seen light to moderate snowfall at relativelywarm temperatures accompanied by moderate south westerly winds. Freezing levels were around 1000 m on Friday and were forecast to lower to valley bottom by the end of the weekend. As the flow turns more north westerly this weekend, weather forecasters predict continuing light to moderate precipitation through Sunday, accompanied by moderate NW winds. SNOWPACK: Last weekends warm precipitation event produced a substantial crust up to about 2100 m when temperatures dropped. Wind slabs from 20 to 40 cm thick have formed above this layer from treeline up into the alpine, mostly on North and East aspects. Subtle weak layers within this recent storm snow are a concern heading into this weekend, as wind and continuing precipitation will continue to add to the load. A series of buried surface hoar weaknesses in the upper two metres will also come under increasing tension as loading increases. AVALANCHES: Significant avalanche activity earlier in the week has tapered off, although isolated human triggered thin slabs were still being reported on Thursday. With continuing wind and snowfall this weekend, it will still be possible to trigger avalanches in wind loaded areas near treeline and above. FORECAST OF AVALANCHE DANGER UP TO MONDAY EVENING (FEBRUARY 3)ALPINE - Considerable TREELINE - Considerable BELOW TREELINE  Moderate  TRAVEL ADVISORY: Watch for areas of significant wind loading at allelevations and take note of any signs of instability such as cracking and whumpfing. Cornices will have weakened with the warm weather. If they fall they can easily trigger avalanches on the slopes below, so keep an eye peeled to slopes above whenever visibility allows.   UPDATE: B.C. Solicitor General Rich Coleman said he's considering emergency funding for an avalanche bulletin to be published every day. Currently, the warning is published three times a week.  Coleman said he may be able to announce funding later this week that would allow the bulletin to be published for the rest of the season. The government had previously cut funding by $17,000 for this year.  But no matter how much information is available, some people will still decide the risk is worth the back-country experience, Coleman said.  He said the government will consider ways of lowering the risk, but no one can ever eliminate it entirely.  Coleman said it would be like closing highways to stop car accidents. UPDATE: Snow scientist Bruce Jamieson, author of numerous books on avalanches, noted that government funding of avalanche awareness in Canada accounts for only 10 per cent to 12 per cent of the total amount spent. That compares with 50 per cent in the United States and nearly 100 per cent in Europe, he said. The British Columbia government, which withdrew a large chunk of funding last year from a critical avalanche-warning bulletin, is now considering increasing its share of the costs to allow the bulletin to appear every day during high-risk periods. UPDATE: Sunday, February 09, 2003 The B.C. government has agreed to pay for more frequent avalanche warning bulletins, after two deadly slides that killed 14 people in eastern B.C. in the past month. Solicitor-General Rich Coleman told an open cabinet meeting Friday the province will pay for a series of "extraordinary bulletins" warning backcountry travellers of elevated avalanche risks. "It will raise one more level of awareness," Mr. Coleman said, but added it won't eliminate death.  The commitment is less than what the Canadian Avalanche Association in Revelstoke, B.C., had hoped for. It wanted enough money for daily bulletins. The association currently produces three bulletins a week during the winter. Under the new funding arrangement, if something significantly changes between those bulletins -- such as freezing rain, severe temperature variations or increased avalanche activity -- the provincial cash will provide for additional bulletins. The number of special bulletins will be determined by the weather, but a government spokesman estimated there could be six over the remainder of the season, meaning an expenditure of an extra $15,000. Mr. Coleman said the entire process of issuing a special bulletin will take no more than three or four hours. Seven Alberta high school students died in an avalanche on Feb. 1, while seven adult skiers were killed in a slide on Jan. 20. Both avalanches occurred near Revelstoke. The B.C. government pulled out of its funding arrangement with the association in 2001. Until that time the province had covered half the $82,000 cost to produce three bulletins a week. The association has been able to continue producing bulletins by raising money in the private sector. A seven-day-a-week bulletin in winter would cost $250,000.Rescue Mode: helicopterInjuries: fatalitiesSource: Canadian Press, Globe and MailContributing Cause(s): AVALANCHE#*#Top#*#Copyright 2001 - 2002, The Alpine Club of Canada.

Yosemite    Back to HomepageYosemite      The Nose in a dayBy Alard Hüfner 1999 Every time I looked up at El Cap in Yosemite Valley Ithought to myself; that is one huge piece of rock. Marianne Pretorius and I climbed the Nose togetherin August. It took us four days. Mike Mason and Dermot Brogan started ahead ofus and it took them 5 days. When one is on a big wall for four days one has tohaul a lot of items up, water, food, sleeping bags etc. and thus the haul bagcan weigh over 40 kg. This slows one's climbing down considerably because thehaulbag needs to get pulled up at every stance. When Hans said to me that he had a free day to goclimbing, I hinted that I was keen to climb the Nose and thus we made plans toclimb it in a day. As Hans had climbed the route 31 times before (he holds therecord for most Nose ascents), he knew the exact rack of gear needed. The rackconsisted of double caming devices from 00 to two inch and one each of three andfour inch. A couple of quick draws and six nuts were taken, mainly micro nuts.One 60 m rope, two ascenders and some aiders. 4 liters of water, some Power barsand peanuts.  We awoke at 05h00am, had breakfast and set off. Westarted the climb at 06h50am. As I did not enjoy the first couple of pitches onmy earlier ascent, Hans led to Sickle Ledge. I took the lead from there, and ledup the Stovelegs (these pitches were named by Warren Harding who opened theroute in 1958 when he used pitons made from the legs of an old stove asprotection). Hans simul-climbed below me. We passed one party of two climberswho happily let us by. Hans lead the last Stovelegs pitch up to Dolt Tower withme jugging on the line he fixed. It is quicker if the leader gets to a stance,fixes the rope and the seconder juggs up and cleans the pitch. We reached DoltTower in just over two hours which, on the previous trip had     taken us 2 days.                                                                 Hans and Alard  I led on towards El Cap Tower. As I had beenup the Texas Flake and the Bootleg Flake with Marianne, we decided on doing theJardine Traverse, a slight variation to the route. Three more pitches and wewere at camp four, the half way mark on the route. We sat for a couple ofminutes, ate some food, drank some water, and enjoyed the amazing view... it wasso cool! Hans led the pitch up to the Great Roof, thenI led the Great Roof which took me 28 minutes to lead and 7 minutes for Hans toclean it, thus taking 35 min for that pitch. I was leading using Hans' superlight aiders and whilst stepping up on a piece of gear, one of the straps on theaiders snapped, letting me drop about 20 cm before it caught me again, thussending some adrenaline through my system. This pitch has only been free climbedby Lynn Hill and Scott Burke. IT LOOKS AMAZINGLY SUPER DIFFICULT!!!!! I free climbed the next pitch called thePancake Flake which has its name due to it being a thin flake that forms a superlay back crack. Free climbing this pitch at about grade 19/20 is exhilaratingbecause one is about 500m up and there is great exposure. We alternated leads most of the way to thetop, passing a team of four Italians on the second last / last pitch. We reached the top nine hours and twenty twominutes after we had started. Brilliant!!!! This was my third time up El Cap and Hans'sixty sixth time. The walk down took 1 hour and 10 minutes. It feltvery good just to be able to sit in the car. This is a super route, with excellent cracks inclean solid granite. Highly recommended!!! I was very fortunate to be able to climb this routewith Hans Florine.For more info on Hans have a look at hiswebpage:  www.speedclimb.comEl Cap in Yosemite, with the approximateline of the Nose in blue  HistoryA typical ascent of the Nose, which takes the average speed climber between12 and 15 hours. The first ascent of the Nose, in 1957 and '58: Warren Harding,a bon vivant from Northern California, spent 45 days over 18 months literallycarving his route by drilling some 200 expansion bolts into the sheer graniteface, infuriating environmentalists but fascinating just about everyone else.Through newspapers and radio the entire nation followed intently as Harding andhis team of two other climbers established four campsites on ledges along theway, all of the sites linked by 1,200 feet of rope secured by nearly 700 pitons.Hundreds of pounds of supplies were winched up by a clumsy device called theDolt Cart -- a pull cart with two bicycle wheels. The circuslike sight causedtraffic jams on the main road below, which at one point prompted a ranger toyell at Harding through a bullhorn, "Get your ass down from there!" In October1958 a ranger demanded that Harding complete the climb by Thanksgiving orabandon it. Finally, on Nov. 12, after a continuous 12-day push, Hardingstaggered over the rim of the Nose. "It was not at all clear to me who was the conqueror and who was conquered,"Harding would say a year later. "I do recall that El Cap seemed to be in muchbetter condition than I was." So began the popularity of big-wall climbing in the U.S., with Yosemite asthe sport's epicenter and Harding as the free-spirited forefather. In lateFebruary, Harding died of liver failure at age 77, and as night fell on theYosemite Valley on May 25, some 400 climbers gathered in a granite quarry behindan abandoned gas station in Bishop, Calif., to celebrate his life. The diversegroup included erstwhile rock stars such as Royal Robbins and Yvon Chouinard,aging Vulgarians -- members of the famously hedonistic sect of climbers who havebeen part of the Yosemite scene since the '60s -- and big-wall vagabonds who hadhitched hundreds of miles. Some recalled Harding's infamous drinking bingeswhile others told salacious tales of his womanizing. At the end of each of hisfirst ascents, for example, a bottle of champagne and a beautiful woman (who hadbeen ferried up a much simpler route) would be waiting. Though his skills didn'tmatch those of his contemporaries Robbins and Chouinard, Harding didn't care towork hard enough to improve. "Screwing is more enjoyable than drilling boltholes," he liked to say. Nevertheless, says veteran Yosemite climber Mike Corbett, "People were justdrawn to him, and no one's been able to match him. He was so full of life." So, too, was the Yosemite Valley. While beachboys on longboards wereproliferating along the Southern California coast in the early '60s, Harding'santiestablishment band of climbers -- including boozers, dopers and drifters --was making merry some 280 miles to the northeast. After descending upon Camp 4,the venerated four-acre dirt patch just east of El Cap, the climbers provokedpark rangers by mooning tourists and stealing campers' food. They held raucousparties long past midnight. They were incorrigibly loud, except when authoritiesasked them about matters like the whereabouts of 240 40-pound bales of pot thatdisappeared from a smuggler's plane that crashed in the Valley in February 1977.For all their hedonism, these wall rats were also supremely gifted athletesand left no rock unscaled in the valley. By the early 1970s every meaningfulbig-wall route in Yosemite had been established, and climbers turned to settingspeed records. By the mid-'70s advances in climbing technique and gear hadenabled climbers to reach the peak of the Nose in less than 24 hours. During anunprecedented 15-hour climb in 1975, Jim Bridwell, John Long and Billy Westbayditched their haul bags and carried a mere 11Ú2 gallons of water -- not tomention two packs of Camel straights, which they lit up while on each of theroute's 34 pitches. "We thought we were so studly," Bridwell says. "We didn'tthink about trying to set another record, because the whole point was just tobreak 24 hours. These guys are a new breed. What they're doing is phenomenal."The first of this new breed, which arrived in the Yosemite Valley in theearly 1980s, included Peter Croft and Dave Schultz, speed-climbing pioneers whoemployed riskier techniques such as simul-climbing, in which two roped-upclimbers ascend together. Croft and Schultz, soon joined by Florine, turned theNose into the autobahn, completing ascents in nine hours and 15 minutes, then8:02, then 6:40. When Croft and a partner went sub-five in 1991, Florineinquired about teaming with him to try to set a new record. Croft agreed, and inJune 1992 the duo took the wall in 4:22. "Everyone thought what they did wasmind-blowing," O'Neill says. "I thought that record would never be broken."  Back to top        Back to Homepage            THESHIELD ROPE SOLOED BY ALARD HUFNERBy Alard Hüfner - November1999 MyFriends and I were sitting in the Yosemite meadows, looking up at climbers on ElCap, when we spotted someone on this blank headwall. That had to be the Shield,it looked so exposed. We were amazed that a climb even went up this piece ofrock. During the next couple of weeks I spoke to people who had done the routeand they all said that it was a real fun route with lots of open space andexposure. WhenMike, Marianne and Dermot had left the Valley, I needed something to climb andso the idea to solo the Shield popped into my head. I had never soloed a bigwall before and only practiced rope soloing on two other occasions.WhenI was learning to rope solo, I had practiced on the first ten pitches of theShield to Mammoth Ledges (same first ten pitches as Free Blast and Salethe).From here there are fixed lines all the way down to the ground. When I was readyfor the route, I jugged up those lines with all my requirements for 5 days. Imanaged two pitches higher than the fixed ropes and as it was getting dark I setup the porta ledge and was comfy asleep, when it started raining. So in the darkand rain I had to re-setup the porta ledge with the fly, which was brand new andhad not been seam sealed. It kept raining until about 8 in the morning. The windwas blowing the whole ledge around. I was not far from this little gully, whichthe rain turned into a river. This all made for an unpleasant adventure. Most ofthe things got fairly wet during the night and as I had lost my enthusiasm tocontinue, retreat was still possible as I was not to high, so I fixed some linesand abseiled all the way down to the ground, leaving the gear at my high point.Spent the weekend re-motivating in San Francisco and had loads of fun, as it wasHalloween.                                                                                                                 The flight of the Albatross        Monday,I jugged back up the lines, climbed some more pitches and set up the ledge belowa big roof. There were three American climbers on a route called “Flight ofthe Albatross”, which runs parallel to the Shield and only about thirty toforty meters to the left. Therefore I had some company as we shouted across toeach other every now and then. In the morning I lead the roof pitch, whichbrought me straight onto the headwall. The exposure started to kick in……..ina big way. The Shield headwall starts about 500m up, is blank, slightly bulging,slightly overhanging and smooth except for a thin crack/seam running up it. Inmany places copper heads and rurps (baby pitons) are the only things that willfit. There were a lot of fixed copper heads so I did not have to place any(which was good because I only had two spare copperheads anyway). I did not clipthe copperheads because in the event of a fall they would probably be rippedout, and I would be unable to put in more. This caused me to lead out severaltimes. This was the case when I was nearing the bolts, but I could just notreach them. There was some old sling tape around the bolt so I clipped my aidersinto that and stood in them. I was about to clip into the bolt direct when Iheard this frightening tear and the next sensation was falling through the airupside down. It was amazing how fast I thought about: the last placement I hadclipped; if it would hold; how far was I going to fall. Thank goodness this oldfixed aluminum piton held and I came to an upside down halt about eight meterslower than I was a few seconds earlier. Thank goodness this rope soloingtechnique works!!!!!! Imanaged to get back up to the bolts making sure I clipped the bolts this timeand then set up camp. To the left and right and up and down there was just blankrock with only this three or four millimetre wide crack/seam leading the way.Threepitches a day is about the going rate for A3 or harder when soloing, andthat’s what I was managing on the headwall. Goingto the toilet can be an interesting affair. The rules are, climbers must carry aporta potty. So, one has to do one’s business into a brown paper bag and thenput this into the porta potty, which can be a bucket with a lid or a large PVCpipe with lids. Aiming into the paper bag is vital when on a porta ledge, assoiling the ledge would not be fun, as this is the kitchen, the bed and thebathroom. Imanaged to take another two falls higher up on the head wall when gear popped.The one fall was about ten meters and as I was falling it was ripping out lotsof the gear I had placed. When I finally came to a halt, all the popped gearslid down the rope towards me, in this instance about 6 pieces of gear. I thenwent back up, hammering in those pitons, which I had been slightly reluctant todo, as getting pitons out is more work. Abovethe head wall, ledges start appearing which makes biving/sleeping much easier.The penultimate pitch is a big fun roof and the last pitch a chimney. The onlyproblem I had was on the last pitch when I was hauling the last two pitches inone. The fifi hook which was holding the haulbag in place would not release fromthe bolt, so I had to abseil back down over the roof…. hanging in mid air a1000m up, then pull myself back into the stance to release the bag to then jumarback up. A couple of meters of grade four scrambling and I was at theTOP!!!!….. time for a beer. Ahhhh after seven days climbing it felt great tobe at the top!Thehike down was absolutely terrible having to carry all that equipment. Theroute was opened in 1972. Thespeed record for the Shield from bottom to top is an incredible ten hoursfifty-eight minutes.Twodays later I left the valley for the last time on this trip, as rain and thefirst snow fell.ExtremeThanks go to Hans Florine, Abby Watkins, Dan Dunkal, Craig Calonica and Dan McDivett, who let me use and abuse their gear. HereAlard is hanging in mid air and the picture is of the shadow of himself and hishaulbag, whilst on the ShieldBack to Top        Back to Homepage#*#Yosemite    Back to HomepageYosemite      The Nose in a day#*#mstheme#*#By Alard Hüfner 1999 #*#Every time I looked up at El Cap in Yosemite Valley Ithought to myself; that is one huge piece of rock. #*#Marianne Pretorius and I climbed the Nose togetherin August.

It feltvery good just to be able to sit in the car. #*#This is a super route, with excellent cracks inclean solid granite. Highly recommended!!! #*#I was very fortunate to be able to climb this routewith Hans Florine.#*#For more info on Hans have a look at hiswebpage:  www.speedclimb.com#*#El Cap in Yosemite, with the approximateline of the Nose in blue#*# #*# #*#History#*#A typical ascent of the Nose, which takes the average speed climber between12 and 15 hours. The first ascent of the Nose, in 1957 and '58: Warren Harding,a bon vivant from Northern California, spent 45 days over 18 months literallycarving his route by drilling some 200 expansion bolts into the sheer graniteface, infuriating environmentalists but fascinating just about everyone else.Through newspapers and radio the entire nation followed intently as Harding andhis team of two other climbers established four campsites on ledges along theway, all of the sites linked by 1,200 feet of rope secured by nearly 700 pitons.Hundreds of pounds of supplies were winched up by a clumsy device called theDolt Cart -- a pull cart with two bicycle wheels. The circuslike sight causedtraffic jams on the main road below, which at one point prompted a ranger toyell at Harding through a bullhorn, "Get your ass down from there!" In October1958 a ranger demanded that Harding complete the climb by Thanksgiving orabandon it. Finally, on Nov. 12, after a continuous 12-day push, Hardingstaggered over the rim of the Nose. #*#"It was not at all clear to me who was the conqueror and who was conquered,"Harding would say a year later. "I do recall that El Cap seemed to be in muchbetter condition than I was." #*#So began the popularity of big-wall climbing in the U.S., with Yosemite asthe sport's epicenter and Harding as the free-spirited forefather. In lateFebruary, Harding died of liver failure at age 77, and as night fell on theYosemite Valley on May 25, some 400 climbers gathered in a granite quarry behindan abandoned gas station in Bishop, Calif., to celebrate his life. The diversegroup included erstwhile rock stars such as Royal Robbins and Yvon Chouinard,aging Vulgarians -- members of the famously hedonistic sect of climbers who havebeen part of the Yosemite scene since the '60s -- and big-wall vagabonds who hadhitched hundreds of miles. Some recalled Harding's infamous drinking bingeswhile others told salacious tales of his womanizing. At the end of each of hisfirst ascents, for example, a bottle of champagne and a beautiful woman (who hadbeen ferried up a much simpler route) would be waiting. Though his skills didn'tmatch those of his contemporaries Robbins and Chouinard, Harding didn't care towork hard enough to improve. "Screwing is more enjoyable than drilling boltholes," he liked to say. #*#Nevertheless, says veteran Yosemite climber Mike Corbett, "People were justdrawn to him, and no one's been able to match him. He was so full of life." #*#So, too, was the Yosemite Valley. While beachboys on longboards wereproliferating along the Southern California coast in the early '60s, Harding'santiestablishment band of climbers -- including boozers, dopers and drifters --was making merry some 280 miles to the northeast. After descending upon Camp 4,the venerated four-acre dirt patch just east of El Cap, the climbers provokedpark rangers by mooning tourists and stealing campers' food. They held raucousparties long past midnight. They were incorrigibly loud, except when authoritiesasked them about matters like the whereabouts of 240 40-pound bales of pot thatdisappeared from a smuggler's plane that crashed in the Valley in February 1977.#*#For all their hedonism, these wall rats were also supremely gifted athletesand left no rock unscaled in the valley. By the early 1970s every meaningfulbig-wall route in Yosemite had been established, and climbers turned to settingspeed records. By the mid-'70s advances in climbing technique and gear hadenabled climbers to reach the peak of the Nose in less than 24 hours. During anunprecedented 15-hour climb in 1975, Jim Bridwell, John Long and Billy Westbayditched their haul bags and carried a mere 11Ú2 gallons of water -- not tomention two packs of Camel straights, which they lit up while on each of theroute's 34 pitches. "We thought we were so studly," Bridwell says. "We didn'tthink about trying to set another record, because the whole point was just tobreak 24 hours. These guys are a new breed. What they're doing is phenomenal."#*#The first of this new breed, which arrived in the Yosemite Valley in theearly 1980s, included Peter Croft and Dave Schultz, speed-climbing pioneers whoemployed riskier techniques such as simul-climbing, in which two roped-upclimbers ascend together. Croft and Schultz, soon joined by Florine, turned theNose into the autobahn, completing ascents in nine hours and 15 minutes, then8:02, then 6:40. When Croft and a partner went sub-five in 1991, Florineinquired about teaming with him to try to set a new record. Croft agreed, and inJune 1992 the duo took the wall in 4:22. "Everyone thought what they did wasmind-blowing," O'Neill says. "I thought that record would never be broken." #*# #*#Back to top        Back to Homepage        #*#msthemeseparator#*#    #*#THESHIELD ROPE SOLOED BY ALARD HUFNER#*#By Alard Hüfner - November1999 #*#MyFriends and I were sitting in the Yosemite meadows, looking up at climbers on ElCap, when we spotted someone on this blank headwall. That had to be the Shield,it looked so exposed. We were amazed that a climb even went up this piece ofrock. During the next couple of weeks I spoke to people who had done the routeand they all said that it was a real fun route with lots of open space andexposure. #*#WhenMike, Marianne and Dermot had left the Valley, I needed something to climb andso the idea to solo the Shield popped into my head. I had never soloed a bigwall before and only practiced rope soloing on two other occasions.#*#WhenI was learning to rope solo, I had practiced on the first ten pitches of theShield to Mammoth Ledges (same first ten pitches as Free Blast and Salethe).From here there are fixed lines all the way down to the ground. When I was readyfor the route, I jugged up those lines with all my requirements for 5 days. Imanaged two pitches higher than the fixed ropes and as it was getting dark I setup the porta ledge and was comfy asleep, when it started raining. So in the darkand rain I had to re-setup the porta ledge with the fly, which was brand new andhad not been seam sealed. It kept raining until about 8 in the morning. The windwas blowing the whole ledge around. I was not far from this little gully, whichthe rain turned into a river. This all made for an unpleasant adventure. Most ofthe things got fairly wet during the night and as I had lost my enthusiasm tocontinue, retreat was still possible as I was not to high, so I fixed some linesand abseiled all the way down to the ground, leaving the gear at my high point.Spent the weekend re-motivating in San Francisco and had loads of fun, as it wasHalloween.#*#                                                                                                                 The flight of the Albatross        #*#Monday,I jugged back up the lines, climbed some more pitches and set up the ledge belowa big roof. There were three American climbers on a route called “Flight ofthe Albatross”, which runs parallel to the Shield and only about thirty toforty meters to the left. Therefore I had some company as we shouted across toeach other every now and then. In the morning I lead the roof pitch, whichbrought me straight onto the headwall. The exposure started to kick in……..ina big way. The Shield headwall starts about 500m up, is blank, slightly bulging,slightly overhanging and smooth except for a thin crack/seam running up it. Inmany places copper heads and rurps (baby pitons) are the only things that willfit. There were a lot of fixed copper heads so I did not have to place any(which was good because I only had two spare copperheads anyway). I did not clipthe copperheads because in the event of a fall they would probably be rippedout, and I would be unable to put in more. This caused me to lead out severaltimes. This was the case when I was nearing the bolts, but I could just notreach them. There was some old sling tape around the bolt so I clipped my aidersinto that and stood in them. I was about to clip into the bolt direct when Iheard this frightening tear and the next sensation was falling through the airupside down. It was amazing how fast I thought about: the last placement I hadclipped; if it would hold; how far was I going to fall. Thank goodness this oldfixed aluminum piton held and I came to an upside down halt about eight meterslower than I was a few seconds earlier. Thank goodness this rope soloingtechnique works!!!!!! #*#Imanaged to get back up to the bolts making sure I clipped the bolts this timeand then set up camp. To the left and right and up and down there was just blankrock with only this three or four millimetre wide crack/seam leading the way.#*#Threepitches a day is about the going rate for A3 or harder when soloing, andthat’s what I was managing on the headwall. #*#Goingto the toilet can be an interesting affair. The rules are, climbers must carry aporta potty. So, one has to do one’s business into a brown paper bag and thenput this into the porta potty, which can be a bucket with a lid or a large PVCpipe with lids. Aiming into the paper bag is vital when on a porta ledge, assoiling the ledge would not be fun, as this is the kitchen, the bed and thebathroom. #*#Imanaged to take another two falls higher up on the head wall when gear popped.The one fall was about ten meters and as I was falling it was ripping out lotsof the gear I had placed. When I finally came to a halt, all the popped gearslid down the rope towards me, in this instance about 6 pieces of gear. I thenwent back up, hammering in those pitons, which I had been slightly reluctant todo, as getting pitons out is more work. #*#Abovethe head wall, ledges start appearing which makes biving/sleeping much easier.The penultimate pitch is a big fun roof and the last pitch a chimney. The onlyproblem I had was on the last pitch when I was hauling the last two pitches inone. The fifi hook which was holding the haulbag in place would not release fromthe bolt, so I had to abseil back down over the roof…. hanging in mid air a1000m up, then pull myself back into the stance to release the bag to then jumarback up. A couple of meters of grade four scrambling and I was at theTOP!!!!….. time for a beer. Ahhhh after seven days climbing it felt great tobe at the top!#*#Thehike down was absolutely terrible having to carry all that equipment. #*#Theroute was opened in 1972. #*#Thespeed record for the Shield from bottom to top is an incredible ten hoursfifty-eight minutes.#*#Twodays later I left the valley for the last time on this trip, as rain and thefirst snow fell.#*#ExtremeThanks go to Hans Florine, Abby Watkins, Dan Dunkal, Craig Calonica and Dan McDivett, who let me use and abuse their gear.#*# #*#HereAlard is hanging in mid air and the picture is of the shadow of himself and hishaulbag, whilst on the Shield#*#Back to Top        Back to Homepage#*#mstheme#*#

Shipwreck Central - Live Dive Blog: Alexander Macomb Archives        Welcome to our Sea Hunters video weblog.   Read entries and watch video live from the dive!                 moreinfo >> Shipwreck Central - Live Dive BlogSHIPWRECK CENTRAL - The "Sea Hunters" reporting live from their latest shipwreck hunting dive.March 02, 2006This Friday and Saturday on History TelevisionU215 & Alexander MacombThe âAlexander Macombâ started life on February 18, 1942, as Hull number 0036 at the Bethlehem-Fairfield Shipyard in Baltimore, Maryland. Six weeks later she slipped down the ways. She completed her sea trials on June 2nd and was named after an American General and hero of the War of 1812. Her new Captain was Carl Froisland a mariner with decades of experience plying the Atlantic. She was steamed to New York and was loaded with her war time cargo of Sherman Tanks, P-38 aircraft and other parts and supplies for the Allied war effort and then sent to Boston to muster in convoy to Halifax and on to Murmansk. On her maiden voyage across the Atlantic she had 41 crew and 25 U.S. Navy gunners on board, a compliment of 66 souls on board, just hours out of Boston she was torpedoed and sunk by a German U-Boat, 10 of her crew were lost. Like nearly 600 of her sister convoy vessels she would end the war forgotten on the bottom of the cold Atlantic Ocean.When the Liberty ships were first put into production, it was thought that if they made it to their destination they had paid their way, making it back would be a bonus. As it turned out, they became the workhorse of the American Merchant Marine. There was a time when you could find them in every sea of the world. They carried the cargo that made allied fighting men the best supplied in the history of warfare. In great convoys they fought their way to England, Russia, Africa, and the islands of the Pacific. The first Liberty ship commissioned took 244 days to build. Henry J. Kaiser, whose shipyards built one-third of all America's ships in World War II, cut that to 72 days in May of 1942. By August of that year, construction time was down to 46 days. The Liberty ship was 442 feet long, and it could carry 10,000 tons of cargo at eleven knots--about 12 MPH. Almost three thousand Liberty ships were built during the war. Since she was the prime cargo carrier, she was also the ship that most of the wartime merchant seamen sailed on. Ship losses were high in the first years of the war. In 1942, sinkings were equivalent to39% of new ship construction. By 1945, the last year of the war, the rate had dropped to 4%. Even so, the toll was high. Almost six hundred ships of the American Merchant Marine were sunk during the war years, and nearly six thousand men of the merchant fleet died while serving aboard them. Now join the âSea Huntersâ as they dive the remains of the âAlexander Macombâ search her extraordinary cargo of planes, tanks and military equipment and tell the story of Liberty Ships, âthe boats that won the warâ.Posted by victoria at 07:50 AMAugust 02, 2005Switching GearsHear a detailed audio report from Jim Delgado, George's Bank is proving to be as challenging as ever.Posted by victoria at 06:52 AMAugust 01, 2005No Working FrequencyJohn Rosborough tries to get in touch with the Ryan Atlantic II, just like AM band signals, these travel further at night.Posted by victoria at 03:23 PMJuly 31, 2005Ryan Atlantic IIJohn Rosborough takes us on board the Ryan Atlantic II to meet with the the Sae Hunters as they prepare to dive the Alexander Macomb.Posted by victoria at 04:43 PMJuly 28, 2005Tropical Storm FranklinYesterday as our team departed for Shelburne, from Halifax, the Voyager of the Seas (a huge cruise ship)was diverted north because of a tropical storm in the Atlantic, sending tropically-dressed vacation-goers to Halifax instead of Bermuda.They were trying to get out of the path of Tropical Storm Franklin.  Ths image shows the National Weather Service/National Hurricane Center advisory number 28 the probability that the center of Franklin will pass within 75 statute miles of a location during the 72 hours beginning at the time indicated in the caption.The team slept on the boat last night and are waiting for word that it is safe to proceed.Posted by victoria at 09:58 AMJuly 27, 2005Bad Weather but not a Bad ThingSince we had a day free, and we're in home port, John Rosborough thought you might like to see what we look like at Sea Hunters/Shipwreck Central Headquarters in Halifax.  You don't need to take my word on the weather.Posted by victoria at 01:41 PMA Day Late and a Dollar ShortI am not sure about the dollar but we are a day late.  The one the you can count on in the North Atlantic is changing weather conditions; they can go from poor to worse in the blink of an eye.  After a weather update from Percy, yesterday morning, they decided to hold off and the entire team left today.  Here is the Environment Canada Weather Forecast for George's Bank issued at 10am AST:A trough of low pressure over northwestern waters will move to lie from the Gulf of St Lawrence through the Bay of Fundy tonight then will move to lie over southeastern waters Thursday afternoon.Light to moderate southerlies well ahead of the trough increase to moderate to strong south to southwesterlies closer to it. Light to moderate westerlies in the vicinity of the trough will increase to moderate to strong northwesterlies in its wake. Winds diminish to light to moderate northerlies further behind to trough.Mariners are advised that small craft warnings for winds of 20 knots or more are in effect for all coastal waters except Northumberland strait northwestern half..Gulf-Magdalen northwestern Half..Chaleur-Miscou..And Anticosti western half.Winds southwest 15 to 20 knots diminishing to light Thursday Morning. Fog banks. Occasional showers developing Thursday morning.Visibility poor in fog and fair in showers. Little temperature change.Outlook for Friday...Moderate easterlies shifting to strong northerlies late in the day. This time we have a larger ROV. Let's hope the winds die down and the fog burns off for The Sea Hunters.

The Story of Color TelevisionSarnoff Revisited (printed November 21)Corrections or additions?This article by Kathleen McGinn Spring was prepared for theNovember 14, 2001 edition ofU.S. 1 Newspaper and amended on November 14. All rights reserved.The Story of Color TelevisionThe year was 1946. World War II had just ended, andAmericans were impatient, eager to catch up on all they had missedduring the war years. Black and white television had made its debutin 1939, shortly  before the war began.  Engineered in RCA Labs onRoute 1, and manufactured by RCA Victor in Camden, the first sets"went over like a lead balloon," says Alex Magoun, directorof the Sarnoff library. Carrying price tags of $200 to $1,000, thesets were wildly expensive, and there was little in the way ofprogrammingfor them to receive. Americans were still enjoying the novelty ofradio in their homes, and a good tabletop radio could be had for $10.After the war, though, the idea of "adding sight to sound,"as David Sarnoff, chairman of RCA put it, began to sound appealing.Production of all kinds of consumer goods, including electronics,had been  curtailed during the war, and there was tremendous pent-updemand. Magoun says CBS, an RCA rival, boldly announced to a war-wearynation: "`Let's leapfrog. Let's go straight to color!'"This was not to be. Not right away. A final standard for colortelevisionwas not approved by the FCC until 1953, and for many years thereafteronly a few programs were broadcast in color. Throughout the 1950sany color program was a big deal, and it was not until 1966 that NBCbecame the first 100 percent color network.As with any invention, there were alternate development branches andmissteps a plenty. It is difficult to fix the exact date when colortelevision was born, but Magoun says late-fall 1951 is as good a dateas any. The IEEE is presenting a Milestone award to Sarnoff, successorto RCA, to honor this accomplishment. Ninety-five percent of thestandardfor broadcasting and receiving color television signals originatedwith RCA. Beyond contributing substantially to the development ofcolor television technology, divisions of the company, under theleadershipof David Sarnoff, also made the sets and produced programs to filltheir screens.Magoun speaks on the history of color television at an event titled"Adding Sight to Sound: Television's Past, Present, andFuture"on the Sarnoff corporate campus on Route 1 on Thursday, November 15,at 8 p.m. Glenn Reitmeier, a Sarnoff vice president and architectof HDTV, the next generation of television, which also was developedat Sarnoff, speaks on where television will go next.Dick Webb, who invented the color television camera, was set to addhis insights. Now retired, and living in Estes Park, Colorado, Webbhas decided against an in-person appearance. "He said there isjust too much stuff going on in New Jersey. He doesn't feel safecominghere," Magoun says. But he is hoping Webb will be able to jointhe gathering via a remote hook-up. The event is sponsored by theACM/IEEE Computer Society and the public is invited. Call908-582-7086.The first design for color television, the one that came from CBS,then a radio network and owner of the Columbia record label, wasmechanical.Based on a system invented by Englishman John Logie Baird in 1928,it was developed by CBS's Peter Goldmark in 1940. A spiraling,perforatedwheel was at the heart of this early color television. A camerascannedimages as the revolving color wheel spun in front of it. It thentransmittedthree fields  --  red, blue, and green, the primary optical colors--  in sequence. At the receiver end a second color wheel,synchronizedwith the first, reconstructed the image."The colors were great," says Magoun of a positive attributeof this system, which is called field sequential. But the image wasfar from perfect. "The problems of the CBS, or any color fieldsequential image, are inherent in the trade-offs," he explains.Each primary color in a frame or displayed image (30 frames per secondin television; 24 frames per second in movies) has to be scanned inat the same time as one monochrome frame. Therefore the eye sees eachsuccessive color for only one-third of the time. This results isflickerwhen something like a runner, or a car, or a basketball moves acrosssuccessive frames. Reducing the brightness of the screen decreasedthe flicker, but resulted in an image that had to be watched in adark room.RCA researchers, replicating CBS's mechanical color television intheir own labs, discovered its limitations for themselves. Televisionsets built around it would need to contain a wheel with red, green,and blue color filters, and would need to be very large  --  threetimes the displayed image, or a three-foot wheel for a 12-inchdisplay,plus the motor to drive the wheel.RCA researchers also considered mechanical color television to bea step backwards. "They already had an electronic black and whitetelevision," says Magoun. "They said, `if it's going to becolor, it should be electronic."Another reason RCA was against adopting CBS's mechanical system waseconomical. The company had just spent a great deal of moneydevelopingblack and white television, and didn't want to see that investmentgo for naught.Vladimir Zworykin had applied for a patent on an electronic televisionsystem in 1923. His iconoscope television camera  --  made ofclear glass, and looking something like a cross between a drum anda medium-size saucepan  --  is on display at the Sarnoff technicallibrary. Along with his kinescope, a specialized cathode-ray tube,it made electronic black and white television practical andmarketable.His portrait hangs in the library, not far from a portrait of DavidSarnoff.Zworykin persuaded Sarnoff that he could develop an electronic colortelevision in two years for $150,000. It took much longer, and thefinal cost was something like $65 million, but Sarnoff, a determinedvisionary, hung on, even when every other network and manufacturergave up on color television.Sarnoff's RCA, which he had joined as a young man androse to lead, made a commitment to electronic color television, andprepared to take its case to the FCC, which held the power to decidewhat standard would be adopted. In the fall of 1949, there were"colorshoot outs," says Magoun of hearings before the FCC. HecharacterizesCBS's impatience to get on with it: "`Look, look,' CBS was saying,`We have color. It's here now.'"But CBS's color television was found to be too flickery, Magoun says.What's more, its bulky system did not fit into the 13, 6-MHz VHFchannelsthat carried black and white television. CBS thought it could solvethat problem by using UHF channels, which had just been madeavailable.UHF, says Magoun, allows for wider channels, but produces a picturethat is significantly inferior to that transmitted via VHF channels.Despite its flaws, and despite the fact that it was not compatiblewith black and white television, CBS's color television technologywas declared the national standard by the FCC in October of 1950.RCA sued the FCC to halt the start of CBS colorcasts. CBS eventuallyprevailed in court in late-May 1951. But while CBS had won the battle,RCA's delaying tactic had won it the war.CBS began color programming on a five-station East Coast network inJune of 1951. But black and white televisions could not receive theprograms. This would not have been a major obstacle for CBS in 1950,when few homes had a television of any kind, but by the time the firstcolor programs were cleared for broadcast, 10.5 million black andwhite televisions had been sold, about half of them by RCA. Consumerswere not about to buy a separate television to receive the few colorprograms available, and so few were sold.Meanwhile, RCA was working at refining its own color televisionsystem.Called triniscope, it was a dot sequential system, as opposed to CBS'sfield sequential system, and was developed from 1946 to 1949. It usedthree cathode-ray tubes, or CRTs, to project each of the primarycolors.This color system used a set of mirrors to combine the colors intoone image reflected off another mirror.Not practical for the average living room, a triniscope televisionset, says Magoun, would have had to be "the size of a laundrymachine.""It was a `kluge,'" says Magoun. "That's what engineerscall something that works, but isn't practical." As unwieldy asCBS's color system, the triniscope's color was even worse.The FCC declined to approve RCA's color system in 1946, and againin 1949. Soon thereafter, America became involved in the Korean Warand the government banned the production of all color televisions.The delay gave RCA time to refine its system.RCA promised the FCC it would do away with the mirrors and come upwith a color system that used just one tube. "In the winter of1949," Sarnoff wrote a blank check," says Magoun. "He toldeveryone in the labs to put on their thinking caps." Working 18hours a day under RCA's Harold Laws, researchers came up with 16differentproposals. The possibilities were narrowed to five, and then to justone.Alfred Schroeder, a retired RCA researcher, now living in Newtown,Pennsylvania, had applied for a patent for a shadow mask CRT in 1947."They decided to take another look at it," says Magoun. Theresearchers decided to go with Schroeder's idea.A shadow mask is a screen full of tiny perforations.This color system combined three separate electron guns, one for eachcolor, in a single CRT. The electron guns shot through tiny holesin the shadow mask, each hitting dots of red, green, or bluephosphors.In early prototypes, there were 150,000 clumps of phosphors, eachone containing all three primary colors. "Each gun had to hitthe right phosphor," says Magoun. "It was a tremendous taskof alignment. Everyone said it couldn't be done, but it worked."RCA's first shadow mask color televisions needed much more tuningthan modern color televisions do, but in eliminating mirrors, multipleCRTs, and rotating wheels, the labs had come up with a design thatwould work in the home. As important, it added color information tothe standard 6-MHz channel, so that existing black and whitetelevisionscould receive color signals.The $65-million race to produce a practical color television was asuccess. In December, 1953, the FCC approved RCA's color televisionformat, and television sets meeting the new standard went on salethe following year.The first RCA color sets cost $995, according to Magoun. That wouldbe the equivalent of $6,186 today. In 1954, it was enough to buy acar, and nearly enough to buy a modest house. The spread in pricewas similar to today's gap between the analog televisions most ofus have and the newer digital televisions.The issue of programming is the same, too. "It's the chicken andegg thing," says Magoun. Even people who could afford thesubstantialpremium for a color set had little incentive to buy one because therewere few color programs. And producers had little incentive to spendextra money on color programming, because so few homes had colortelevision.The same situation exists today with digital television.Despite all obstacles, Sarnoff forged ahead. A self-made man, he hademigrated from Russia to the Lower East Side of Manhattan with hisfamily when he was nine. At the age of 15, he left school to helpsupport his family. Working for the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Companyin 1912, he picked up a message relayed from ships at sea: "S.S.Titanic ran into iceberg, sinking fast."Rising quickly in Marconi, which became RCA after its U.S. assetswere purchased by General Electric, Sarnoff proposed an idea for a"radio music box," for radio channels, and then for a radionetwork, which became NBC, an RCA subsidiary. He then turned hisattentionto television, and soon thereafter, to color television, and refusedto give up.By the mid-1950s, every other company stopped manufacturing colortelevisions, and few produced color programming. But Sarnoff, losingsome $65 million for RCA over a decade, persisted, despite the factthat he was angering the the board of directors. Finally, in 1964,the tide turned, and RCA began to profit handsomely from itsinvestmentin color television.The first commercial television program on color film was an episodeof Dragnet that aired in December, 1953. It was followed by suchmilestonesas a live telecast of the Tournament of Roses parade the followingmonth, the first color broadcast of a president (Dwight Eisenhowerin June, 1955), the first color coverage of the World Series (Dodgersvs. Yankees in September, 1955), and the first colorcast cartoons(the Flintstones and the Jetsons in fall, 1962).The premier of Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color in September,1961, was a turning point, persuading consumers to go out and purchasecolor televisions. But it was not until 1966 that NBC became the firstnetwork to show the color we all now take for granted on all of itsprograms. It had taken 25 years from color television to go from itsearliest prototypes to mass acceptance.  This, Magoun says, is aboutthe time every new technology takes to really catch on. He pointsout that radio was used for ship-to-shore communications for morethan two decades before it achieved broad penetration in Americanhomes. The personal computer, available since 1975, is now only inabout 60 percent of households.Magoun, who has been director of the David Sarnoff library for alittleover a year, says so much of the communications and electronicstechnologywe use every day came out of RCA labs. He is on a mission to preserveand display milestones in the development these technologies at theSarnoff library. It was Sarnoff himself who oversaw the installationof the dark wood bookcases, fronted with glass, that run along itswalls, and the large glass display cases in the middle of the room.Sarnoff, who died in 1971 at the age of 80, studiedpresidential libraries before designing his own. "He spent thelast 20 years of his life collecting awards," Magoun says of RCA'sleader. It is those awards  --  bronze medals, citations, and animpressive sterling silver model of a sailing ship  --  that fillthe library. Magoun, however, says that Sarnoff was much more thana sum of all the scrolls he collected and pictures of world leaderswho honored him. "Sarnoff was innovation," says Magoun. Therare entrepreneur who appreciated, and listened to, engineers, Sarnofftook color television, and so much more, from the lab to practicaluse by consumers, hospitals, businesses, and the military.Magoun began to appreciate the man, and what he and his researchersaccomplished, as he spent time in the library researching the historyof the phonograph record for his dissertation. A student at theUniversityof Maryland working on a Ph.D. in the history of technology, he didresearch one day a week in the library. As he worked, he spoke withSarnoff staffers about his opinion that Sarnoff's library shouldshowcasetechnology, not just the man's life, and should do so in a way thatwould engage scholars, school children, and the public.Putting forth a convincing argument, Magoun was hired, and has begunthe job of integrating into the library lab notebooks, sketches, andinventions telling the story of how Sarnoff scientists have workedon the technologies that underlie so much of life in the 21st century.Among them is the world's oldest electron microscope. It sits sevenfeet tall and weighs 1,200 pounds. A photo above the microscope showsZworykin working with Jim Hillier, inventor of the microscope who wenton to become RCA's vice president of research and winner of the AlbertLasker Award for Basic Medical Research. He is also father of BobHillier, founder of the Hillier Group architectural firm. "Zworykinhired Hillier and provided protection from RCA's beancounters instimulating creation of what could be called the medical electronicsindustry," says Magoun.Also on display, sitting atop a case of Sarnoff's medals, is one ofthe earliest optical recording disks. Developed by Bob Bartolini inthe 1970s to early-1980s, it is the precursor of the re-writable CD.Bartolini is now Sarnoff's vice president of international business.Another new exhibit at the library is the science notebook StevenHofstein used in working on the MOS transistor. This metal-oxidesemiconductorfield effect transistor is the basis for every computer and electronicdevice. "It was a significant breakthrough in theearly-1960s,"says Magoun.Fleshing out the library's displays a little at a time, Magoun speaksof his desire to have more exhibits that would illustrate theprogressionof Sarnoff's work. "It would be great to have a line oftelevisionsfrom the '30s, and the '40s, and right on through, all showingSeinfeld,"he gives as an example. This, he says, would be an engaging way ofgetting visitors to ask questions, and make comparisons.Magoun, a 1981 graduate of Trinity College, studied history there,and went on to earn a master's in history at the University of EastAnglia. One of four brothers, he grew up in Manchester, Massachusetts,"between the Perfect Storm and the Salem witches." His mother,Faith, worked her way up from volunteer to director of the Lynn,Massachusetts,historical society. That was not an easy task in the 1970s, Magounsays. His father, Frank, became a bond trader after studying historyin college, and being talked out of a career as a professor by hisfather, a Harvard professor who thought the profession did not payenough.Magoun wonders if his father would have been happier as a professor,yet he himself ran into frustrating barriers on a college campus.After earning his master's degree, he returned to Trinity to coachtrack and cross country. As an undergraduate, he had set the school's5K record  --  14.40.97, which has yet to be beaten. He enjoyedcoaching,but he was a part-time coach, and as such had to coach six teams,while full-time coaches had to coach only two. When the college wouldnot make the track coaching position full time, he felt he had toleave.Magoun is settling into Princeton. Many of his first friends aremembersof the Princeton Hash House Harriers. He explains that hashing isan extreme form of cross country running where one runner marks acourse in varied, and difficult terrain  --  behind shopping centers,across brooks, through back alleys  --  and the others try to findtheir way through it.Now the hashers are in trouble in a number of states. The reason?Says Magoun: "You have to mark the trail with something. You wantsomething biodegradable. What do you use?" Ah, of course, flour!The substance works beautifully, but police in at least four stateshave had to respond to alarmed residents, who came upon the stuffand suspected it to be anthrax. Investigating costs a fair amountof money, and peeved police departments have started sending thehashersthe bills.Following chalk-marked trails, Magoun continues to run on Sundayswith the Princeton Hash House Harriers. It is one of his few leisureactivities as he spends 10 to 12 hours a day at the David Sarnofflibrary and working on a website for it. One thing he does not doon his time off is watch television. As Magoun prepares to mark colortelevision's 50th anniversary, he notes that the sets are asubiquitousin American homes as are faucets. But he does not own one."After I come home," he says, "the last thing I want todo is look at a screen." Even if it displays all of its programsin living color.--Kathleen McGinn SpringTop Of PageSarnoff Revisited (printed November 21)On behalf of the David Sarnoff Library, I would liketo thank you and your writer, Kathleen McGinn Spring, for theextensivecover story on the history of the invention of color television (U.S.1, November 14). We had a full and appreciative audience of over 250people in Sarnoff Corporation's auditorium on November 15, thanksin part to the article. Those who missed the illustrated history anddemonstration of RCA's first color television receiving convertedHDTV signals from NJN are invited to attend the reception for anddedication of the IEEE Milestone for the invention ofmonochrome-compatible,electronic color television at the RCA Laboratories on Thursday,November29, at 4 p.m. Please contact Alice Archer at 609-734-2636, or E-mail:(aarcher@sarnoff.com).New Jersey has been the Innovation Garden State at least since Edisonstarted spinning off ventures in Menlo Park. The state's 20th centuryhistory is filled with the technologies we take for granted, fromelectronic television and antibiotics to the transistor and liquidcrystal displays.

All rights reserved.The Story of Color TelevisionThe year was 1946. World War II had just ended, andAmericans were impatient, eager to catch up on all they had missedduring the war years. Black and white television had made its debutin 1939, shortly  before the war began.  Engineered in RCA Labs onRoute 1, and manufactured by RCA Victor in Camden, the first sets"went over like a lead balloon," says Alex Magoun, directorof the Sarnoff library. Carrying price tags of $200 to $1,000, thesets were wildly expensive, and there was little in the way ofprogrammingfor them to receive. Americans were still enjoying the novelty ofradio in their homes, and a good tabletop radio could be had for $10.After the war, though, the idea of "adding sight to sound,"as David Sarnoff, chairman of RCA put it, began to sound appealing.Production of all kinds of consumer goods, including electronics,had been  curtailed during the war, and there was tremendous pent-updemand. Magoun says CBS, an RCA rival, boldly announced to a war-wearynation: "`Let's leapfrog. Let's go straight to color!'"This was not to be. Not right away. A final standard for colortelevisionwas not approved by the FCC until 1953, and for many years thereafteronly a few programs were broadcast in color. Throughout the 1950sany color program was a big deal, and it was not until 1966 that NBCbecame the first 100 percent color network.As with any invention, there were alternate development branches andmissteps a plenty. It is difficult to fix the exact date when colortelevision was born, but Magoun says late-fall 1951 is as good a dateas any. The IEEE is presenting a Milestone award to Sarnoff, successorto RCA, to honor this accomplishment. Ninety-five percent of thestandardfor broadcasting and receiving color television signals originatedwith RCA. Beyond contributing substantially to the development ofcolor television technology, divisions of the company, under theleadershipof David Sarnoff, also made the sets and produced programs to filltheir screens.Magoun speaks on the history of color television at an event titled"Adding Sight to Sound: Television's Past, Present, andFuture"on the Sarnoff corporate campus on Route 1 on Thursday, November 15,at 8 p.m. Glenn Reitmeier, a Sarnoff vice president and architectof HDTV, the next generation of television, which also was developedat Sarnoff, speaks on where television will go next.Dick Webb, who invented the color television camera, was set to addhis insights.

It was Sarnoff himself who oversaw the installationof the dark wood bookcases, fronted with glass, that run along itswalls, and the large glass display cases in the middle of the room.Sarnoff, who died in 1971 at the age of 80, studiedpresidential libraries before designing his own. "He spent thelast 20 years of his life collecting awards," Magoun says of RCA'sleader. It is those awards  --  bronze medals, citations, and animpressive sterling silver model of a sailing ship  --  that fillthe library. Magoun, however, says that Sarnoff was much more thana sum of all the scrolls he collected and pictures of world leaderswho honored him. "Sarnoff was innovation," says Magoun. Therare entrepreneur who appreciated, and listened to, engineers, Sarnofftook color television, and so much more, from the lab to practicaluse by consumers, hospitals, businesses, and the military.Magoun began to appreciate the man, and what he and his researchersaccomplished, as he spent time in the library researching the historyof the phonograph record for his dissertation. A student at theUniversityof Maryland working on a Ph.D. in the history of technology, he didresearch one day a week in the library. As he worked, he spoke withSarnoff staffers about his opinion that Sarnoff's library shouldshowcasetechnology, not just the man's life, and should do so in a way thatwould engage scholars, school children, and the public.Putting forth a convincing argument, Magoun was hired, and has begunthe job of integrating into the library lab notebooks, sketches, andinventions telling the story of how Sarnoff scientists have workedon the technologies that underlie so much of life in the 21st century.Among them is the world's oldest electron microscope. It sits sevenfeet tall and weighs 1,200 pounds. A photo above the microscope showsZworykin working with Jim Hillier, inventor of the microscope who wenton to become RCA's vice president of research and winner of the AlbertLasker Award for Basic Medical Research. He is also father of BobHillier, founder of the Hillier Group architectural firm. "Zworykinhired Hillier and provided protection from RCA's beancounters instimulating creation of what could be called the medical electronicsindustry," says Magoun.Also on display, sitting atop a case of Sarnoff's medals, is one ofthe earliest optical recording disks. Developed by Bob Bartolini inthe 1970s to early-1980s, it is the precursor of the re-writable CD.Bartolini is now Sarnoff's vice president of international business.Another new exhibit at the library is the science notebook StevenHofstein used in working on the MOS transistor. This metal-oxidesemiconductorfield effect transistor is the basis for every computer and electronicdevice. "It was a significant breakthrough in theearly-1960s,"says Magoun.Fleshing out the library's displays a little at a time, Magoun speaksof his desire to have more exhibits that would illustrate theprogressionof Sarnoff's work. "It would be great to have a line oftelevisionsfrom the '30s, and the '40s, and right on through, all showingSeinfeld,"he gives as an example. This, he says, would be an engaging way ofgetting visitors to ask questions, and make comparisons.Magoun, a 1981 graduate of Trinity College, studied history there,and went on to earn a master's in history at the University of EastAnglia. One of four brothers, he grew up in Manchester, Massachusetts,"between the Perfect Storm and the Salem witches." His mother,Faith, worked her way up from volunteer to director of the Lynn,Massachusetts,historical society. That was not an easy task in the 1970s, Magounsays. His father, Frank, became a bond trader after studying historyin college, and being talked out of a career as a professor by hisfather, a Harvard professor who thought the profession did not payenough.Magoun wonders if his father would have been happier as a professor,yet he himself ran into frustrating barriers on a college campus.After earning his master's degree, he returned to Trinity to coachtrack and cross country. As an undergraduate, he had set the school's5K record  --  14.40.97, which has yet to be beaten. He enjoyedcoaching,but he was a part-time coach, and as such had to coach six teams,while full-time coaches had to coach only two. When the college wouldnot make the track coaching position full time, he felt he had toleave.Magoun is settling into Princeton. Many of his first friends aremembersof the Princeton Hash House Harriers. He explains that hashing isan extreme form of cross country running where one runner marks acourse in varied, and difficult terrain  --  behind shopping centers,across brooks, through back alleys  --  and the others try to findtheir way through it.Now the hashers are in trouble in a number of states. The reason?Says Magoun: "You have to mark the trail with something. You wantsomething biodegradable. What do you use?" Ah, of course, flour!The substance works beautifully, but police in at least four stateshave had to respond to alarmed residents, who came upon the stuffand suspected it to be anthrax. Investigating costs a fair amountof money, and peeved police departments have started sending thehashersthe bills.Following chalk-marked trails, Magoun continues to run on Sundayswith the Princeton Hash House Harriers. It is one of his few leisureactivities as he spends 10 to 12 hours a day at the David Sarnofflibrary and working on a website for it. One thing he does not doon his time off is watch television. As Magoun prepares to mark colortelevision's 50th anniversary, he notes that the sets are asubiquitousin American homes as are faucets. But he does not own one."After I come home," he says, "the last thing I want todo is look at a screen." Even if it displays all of its programsin living color.--Kathleen McGinn SpringTop Of PageSarnoff Revisited (printed November 21)On behalf of the David Sarnoff Library, I would liketo thank you and your writer, Kathleen McGinn Spring, for theextensivecover story on the history of the invention of color television (U.S.1, November 14). We had a full and appreciative audience of over 250people in Sarnoff Corporation's auditorium on November 15, thanksin part to the article. Those who missed the illustrated history anddemonstration of RCA's first color television receiving convertedHDTV signals from NJN are invited to attend the reception for anddedication of the IEEE Milestone for the invention ofmonochrome-compatible,electronic color television at the RCA Laboratories on Thursday,November29, at 4 p.m. Please contact Alice Archer at 609-734-2636, or E-mail:(aarcher@sarnoff.com).New Jersey has been the Innovation Garden State at least since Edisonstarted spinning off ventures in Menlo Park. The state's 20th centuryhistory is filled with the technologies we take for granted, fromelectronic television and antibiotics to the transistor and liquidcrystal displays. It is in everyone's best interest to promote thathistory, for the sake of education, state pride, tourism, and thebusiness acumen that arises from understanding the causes of ourtechnologicaland commercial failures and successes.Alexander B. MagounDirector, David Sarnoff Library"mailto:amagoun@sarnoff.com">amagoun@sarnoff.com#*#Editor's note: In processing all that data, a fewsignalsgot crossed. At one point the development of monochrome televisionwas erroneously juxtaposed with color television. The correctstatement:"In 1929 Zworykin told Sarnoff he could develop electronicmonochromeTV in two years. The cost to RCA by 1949 was some $10 million in R&D;,manufacture, service, and programming."Also the story incorrectly identified the inventor of the electronmicroscope: It was James Hillier. "Zworykin hired Hillier andprovided protection from RCA's bean counters in stimulating creationof what could be called the medical electronics industry," saysMagoun. Hillier won numerous awards for his efforts to successfullycommercialize what had previously been a laboratory curiosity,includingthe 1960 Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research, sometimesknown as "America's Nobel Prize."Corrections or additions?#*#This page is published by PrincetonInfo.com-- the web site for U.S. 1 Newspaper in Princeton, New Jersey.#*#

Kathleen Sebelius isn't proposing something novel when she suggests having a state board pick from among competing developers to determine who manages state-owned casinos.The state went through a similar exercise repeatedly in the 1980s and 1990s, when it decided which developers could build, own and operate dog and horse tracks where betting on races would be permitted.The state's experiences with pari-mutuel racing left lessons for Sebelius and legislators to ponder now, as they consider expanding gambling in Kansas and leaving big decisions about lucrative management contracts to a new board's members."The work these guys are going to do will be some pretty heavy lifting," said Matt All, Sebelius' chief counsel.Sebelius' plan, which she is expected to unveil this week, will call for large, state-owned "destination" casinos designed to attract gamblers from both inside and outside Kansas. The board will decide how many casinos will be built, where they will be located, and who will manage them, though the governor assumes at least one will be in Wyandotte County.As of last week, Sebelius had not hashed out all the details, including the size of the board or its composition. However, All said the board would be a public body, "subject to very strict ethics rules.""One of the most important objectives of our approach is to set up a system that the industry doesn't run," All said.Sebelius told reporters last week that she wanted a process in which each proposal is "really regarded as a business proposal, with a feasibility study and meeting certain criteria."In 1987, Gov. Mike Hayden and legislators faced setting up a new Racing Commission after voters during the previous year approved a constitutional amendment to permit betting on dog and horse races. Hayden promised racing would be "squeaky clean."Then, he appointed commission members who had little experience with pari-mutuel racing and an executive director who had served as Garden City's police chief. Within two years, the commission and its chairman, former Kansas Supreme Court Chief Justice Alfred Schroeder, faced intense public criticism over licensing decisions.Charles McAtee, a Topeka attorney who represented an unsuccessful southeast Kansas applicant in the first round of pari-mutuel licensing hearings, said members of a new gambling board should come to their jobs with a good deal of knowledge about the casino industry."She could even consider appointing some outside consultant from Vegas or Atlantic City," McAtee said, referring to Sebelius.He and former Kansas House Speaker Bob Miller, of Wellington, said the new gambling board must rely on independent sources, not developers, for information.In 1988 and 1989, the Racing Commission did not hire its own consultants or experts to evaluate applications. McAtee said initial licensing decisions were based on "blue smoke and mirrors" from developers.Miller, who helped write pari-mutuel legislation in 1987 and later served on the racing commission, said, "The casino people are going to come in with well-educated, smooth numbers people."Sebelius and legislators also would be wise to promote open discussions of competing gambling proposals.In its first two years of existence, the racing commission went into executive session a staggering 107 times - as often as it went to lunch. When it decided in July 1988 to grant licenses for The Woodlands, in Kansas City, Kan., its vote followed two days of closed-door sessions but only a brief debate in public.The secrecy seriously undercut the commission's credibility, so much so that when Schroeder retired in 1990, one legislator declared, "A breath of fresh air has come rolling in."And, after 15 years, McAtee said, he still doesn't understand why the commission rejected his clients' application."They never really did, I believe, a good job in an open public meeting of explaining their rationale," he said. "We were never told why we were not selected."Finally, the state's experience with pari-mutuel racing suggests that Sebelius and legislators ought to expect plenty of litigation.Perhaps the saddest example from pari-mutuel racing is that of Camptown Greyhound Park, north of Pittsburg.The racing commission issued a license for a southeast Kansas track in 1988, but four developers came into, then left, the project before the track opened for less than six money-losing months in 1995. In between, backers of a track saw construction prevented by two Kansas Supreme Court cases, the bankruptcy of one financial backer and the federal fraud conviction of another.Sebelius should remember some of the controversies of Kansas pari-mutuel racing's early years. She began eight years in the Kansas House in 1987 and served on the committee that reviewed gambling legislation.And, she said last week, "I probably need to go back and review exactly what was done."» View all TopJobs©Copyright 2004 The Morning SunContactThe Morning Sun StaffPrivacy Policy#*#HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"#*#The Morning Sun: Race tracks teach lesson on gambling 01/26/04Advanced Search HomeArchivesClassifieds Contact us GorillaAutos.com Headlines MovieListingsRealEstateSubscribeto The Morning SunSundayMagazineTVListingsBusinessEntertainmentLegislatureLifestyleLocal NewsObituariesOpinionOutdoor GuidePicture ThisPSUGorillas.comRegional NewsSportsU.S. WorldWellness Guide Big12.netChiefsZoneGolfNewsCatZoneHawkZonePrepZonePSUGorillas.comDiscussionBoardVideo ToursVirtual ToursClassifiedsStocksConvention& Visitor's BureauGirardSchoolsGreenbushPittsburgChamberPittsburgSchoolsSoutheastKansas EnvirosourceStory last updated at12:38 a.m.Monday, January 26, 2004[an error occurred while processing this directive]Race tracks teach lesson on gamblingAn AP News AnalysisBy JOHN HANNAThe Associated PressTOPEKA - Gov.

Story of Rainier - Article XXIII - Lodges--(Concluded)<<<PreviousArticleTable of ContentsT H E   S T O R Y   OF    R A I N I E R1 8 0 5  1 9 2 5 ARTICLE XXIIILodges--(Concluded) The Ladies of the Maccabees of the World were organized in Rainier on July 17, 1897.They met in the little, all-useful store building of Dean Blanchard, on what is now thecorner at East Fifth and A streets, effected their organization and elected officers. The first officers from this charter list were: Mrs. Victoria A. Perry, past ladycommander; Mrs. Edith E. Clark, lady commander; Mrs. Emily Dryden, lady lieutenantcommander; Miss Anna Belle Perry, lady record keeper; Mrs. Alice Gilbreath, lady Financekeeper; Mrs. Veronica Herman, lady chaplain; Mrs. Etta Huycke, lady at arms; Miss HollisShatto, lady sergeant, Mrs. Mary J. Pomeroy, lady sentinel; Mrs. Julia M. Both, ladypicket. According to the record that I have, Miss Caroline E. Pomeroy was the only memberof the charter list who was not an officer. This organization since then has been changed to the Women's Benefit Association ofMaccabees. Its review, number 20, is still an active organization in Rainier. In the following year, Ivy Camp 373, Woodmen of the World, was instituted. The charterlist for this lodge consisted of: Charles A. Burch, George Buckbee, C.L. Clark, A.L.Clark, W.J. Deitz, W.H. Dryden, Philip Drouth, H.L. Groves, R.G. Johnson, James Jesse,E.A. James, G.W. Gordon, S.H. Kistner, A.B. Little, W.E. Newsom, C.C. Pritchard, ThomasPatton, E.H. Philbrook, A. Parker, G.A. Riggs, W.M. Riggs, J.A. Schunesen, J. Cy Smith,F.J. Sundblom, J.J. Schmidt. The charter was granted on February 22, 1898, with officers as follows: Consul, T.H.Woodruff; escort, W.H. Dryden; advisor, S.H. Kistner; watchman, A.A. Johnson; banker, J.R.Caldwell; sentry, C.F. Willis; clerk, J. Cy Smith; physician, A.P. McLaren; managers, E.A.Anfys, Philip Drout, W.J. Deitz. Women of Woodcraft, Riverside Circle 315, was instituted on November 21,1900. This isan auxiliary to the Woodmen of the World. The charter officers were: Annie Schunesen,adviser; Margaret G. Aaron, magician; Flora G. Marquit, past guardian neighbor; George B.Hallin, clerk; Flora J. Shelton, attendant; Emily A. Dryden, inner sentinel; Nannie B.Goff, guardian neighbor; Evelyn E. Woodruff, banker; Mrs. Burt Deitz, captain of theguards; Dr. M.K. Hall, outer sentinel; managers, Emma F. Spinney, Nina B. Haggin, Alta M.Lee. Following the "Woodmen of the World and Riverside Circle", the Odd Fellowslodge was next in Rainier. Lodge 151, I.O.O.F., was instituted on March 2, 1901, following a dispensation grantedon February 23 of the same year. The charter list was small, containing but six names:J.J. Schmidt, W.J. Deitz, Rosswell R. Patch, U.C. Adams, L.E. Clark, S.C. Rich. Though itsbeginning was small, the Odd Fellows lodge has grown to the place where it is now one ofthe largest lodges in Rainier. On May 19, 1904, Fern Rebekah Lodge 133 was instituted, with eleven charterpetitioners: W.C. Fischer, Wm. Symons, Lewis Brant, R.H. Mitchell, A.L. Clark, G.A.Taggert, Eva Brant, Mary J. Clark, Edith E. Clark, Emily Mitchell, Eleanor Symons. Columbia Encampment 89, another branch of the Odd Fellows lodge, was instituted on May22, 1923, with 20 members, and, on December 23 of the same year, Columbia Canton 19 wasinstituted with 15 members. Of the later lodges, the Moose lodge is the newest in Rainier. Lodge 1435, L.O.O.M.,was instituted October 8, 1913, with a charter list of fifty members--the largest by farof any lodge previously launched in Rainier. This list is as follows: Lee Clark, FredBenjamin, R. Touzel, C.F. Tucker, C. Crawford, John Larson, A. Burke, L.E. Clark, C.C.Fowler. W.B. Smith, W.C. Parker, Harry C. Smith, P.C. Evans, Andrew Lee, Ray Elbon, C.A.Nutt, Charles Hallirian, Vic Frirer, E.J. Remy, G.B. Graham, W. Oberg, C.M. Fowler,Charles Rainer, Miles Sheerin. W.A. Rader, W. Curran, C.A. Parker, C.T. Bross, E.O.Brough, Joseph Keeley, Harry L. Elbon, George Anderson, John Mauris, John Orn, P. Leallen,S. Styke, C. Murphy, George Weaver, John Kinamas, Frank Sherwood, William Mauris, O.Nelson, F.M. McDonald, H.S. Schroeder, W.E. Welch, Eric Wilson, Walter Hunter, E.S.Cochran, J.R. Nutbrown, Thomas Hunter. The Moose lodge lost its charter in the fire on the morning of June 28.1924, andanother was issued on July 18, of the same year. Women of Mooseheart Chapter 90 was instituted in Rainier on May 28, 1923. This is thelatest of the lodge additions. It is safe to say that Rainier almost never was without a lodge, for the Masonic lodgecame here in 1858, which was but a very few years after the opening chapters of Rainier'sknown history started. Following that time, of course, the Masonic lodge was the only oneuntil 1893, so far as any record goes that I have had access to, but after that time thelodges came in rapid succession. It is rather doubtful if there are many towns of the sizeof Rainier where there is such a large lodge membership as there is here.

On May 19, 1904, Fern Rebekah Lodge 133 was instituted, with eleven charterpetitioners: W.C. Fischer, Wm. Symons, Lewis Brant, R.H. Mitchell, A.L. Clark, G.A.Taggert, Eva Brant, Mary J. Clark, Edith E. Clark, Emily Mitchell, Eleanor Symons. Columbia Encampment 89, another branch of the Odd Fellows lodge, was instituted on May22, 1923, with 20 members, and, on December 23 of the same year, Columbia Canton 19 wasinstituted with 15 members. Of the later lodges, the Moose lodge is the newest in Rainier. Lodge 1435, L.O.O.M.,was instituted October 8, 1913, with a charter list of fifty members--the largest by farof any lodge previously launched in Rainier. This list is as follows: Lee Clark, FredBenjamin, R. Touzel, C.F. Tucker, C. Crawford, John Larson, A. Burke, L.E. Clark, C.C.Fowler. W.B. Smith, W.C. Parker, Harry C. Smith, P.C. Evans, Andrew Lee, Ray Elbon, C.A.Nutt, Charles Hallirian, Vic Frirer, E.J. Remy, G.B. Graham, W. Oberg, C.M. Fowler,Charles Rainer, Miles Sheerin. W.A. Rader, W. Curran, C.A. Parker, C.T. Bross, E.O.Brough, Joseph Keeley, Harry L. Elbon, George Anderson, John Mauris, John Orn, P. Leallen,S. Styke, C. Murphy, George Weaver, John Kinamas, Frank Sherwood, William Mauris, O.Nelson, F.M. McDonald, H.S. Schroeder, W.E. Welch, Eric Wilson, Walter Hunter, E.S.Cochran, J.R. Nutbrown, Thomas Hunter. The Moose lodge lost its charter in the fire on the morning of June 28.1924, andanother was issued on July 18, of the same year. Women of Mooseheart Chapter 90 was instituted in Rainier on May 28, 1923. This is thelatest of the lodge additions. It is safe to say that Rainier almost never was without a lodge, for the Masonic lodgecame here in 1858, which was but a very few years after the opening chapters of Rainier'sknown history started. Following that time, of course, the Masonic lodge was the only oneuntil 1893, so far as any record goes that I have had access to, but after that time thelodges came in rapid succession. It is rather doubtful if there are many towns of the sizeof Rainier where there is such a large lodge membership as there is here.

More Books by Robert Andrew Powell ISBN: 0802141536 All Product Details   Available at:Quimby WarehouseSynopses & Reviews Publisher Comments: Although its participants are still in grade school, Pop Warner football is serious business in Miami, where local teams routinely advance to the national championships. Games draw thousands of fans; recruiters vie for nascent talent; drug dealers and rap stars bankroll teams; and the stakes are so high that games sometimes end in gunshots. In America's poorest neighborhood, troubled parents dream of NFL stardom for children who long only for a week in Disney World at the Pop Warner Super Bowl. In 2001, journalist Robert Andrew Powell spent a year following two teams through roller-coaster seasons. The Liberty City Warriors, former national champs, will suffer the team's first-ever losing season. The Palmetto Raiders, undefeated for two straight years, will be rewarded for good play with limo rides and steak dinners. But their flamboyant coach (the "Darth Vader of youth football") will face defeat in a down-to-the-wire playoff game. We Own This Game is an inside-the-huddle look into a world of innocence and corruption, where every kickoff bares political, social, and racial implications; an unforgettable drama that shows us just what it is to win and to lose in America.back to top What Our Readers Are Saying Be the first to add a comment for a chance to win! back to top Product Details ISBN:0802141536 Author:Powell, Robert Andrew Publisher:Grove Press Author:Powell, Robert Andrew Subject:Football - General Subject:Sports & Recreation - Football Publication Date:September 2004 Binding:Paperback Language:English Pages:208 Dimensions:825x550  back to top Find related books in: Section-Aisle Sports and Fitness - Football General  HelpSecurity and PrivacyShippingMoney Back GuaranteeOrder by PhoneContact UsNewslettersEventsPartner ProgramBlogEmploymentAbout Powell's BooksLaurels! 2005 Best of the WebEPIC Official BooksellerForbes FavoriteSexiest StaffRSS 2.0Log OffCopyright © 1994-2006 Powells.com Terms of Use#*#html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"#*#Powell's Books - We Own This Game: A Season the in the Adult World of Youth Football by Robert Andrew PowellSkip navigationBrowse SectionsBestsellersNew ArrivalsSaleeBooksGift CardsAdvanced Search   RELATED AISLES Sports and Fitness Football General   RECENTLY VIEWEDNo ItemsRECENTLY VIEWEDRead the original essay by David Treuer and save 30% on The Translation of Dr. Apelles.$16.10Hardcover   $14.00TRADE PAPER, NEW                                              Ships in 1 to 3 days                      Qty StoreSection3 Quimby WarehouseSports and Fitness- Football General                       1 Quimby WarehouseSports and Fitness- Football General                       Hide store locationsClick here to show storeand shelf locations We Own This Game: A Season the in the Adult World of Youth Football    by Robert Andrew Powell  About This Book Synopses & Reviews Comment on this title and you could win free books!

"Quantum physics has provided an important platform for such a belief in recent years. There are many in my profession who now believe that medical science is the pursuit of helping the patient from the bottom up while a belief or faith in a higher consciousness is helping the patient from the top down."Dr Powell, who was brought up in the Christian tradition', and has published medical papers in which he admits experimenting with LSD and mescaline with his professor's approval while studying medicine and psychiatry, was careful to make a distinction between religion and spirituality when describing what he meant by a faith in a higher power."I see the world's religions as rivers, all flowing into the same sea," he said.During a question-and-answer session, which followed Dr Powell's talk, a member of the audience drew a round of applause when he described how he had witnessed what the doctor had described, first hand, after attending addicts' meetingsHe said: "People who have repeatedly failed to stop drinking or taking drugs for many years, miraculously stop when they find a higher power through Alcoholics and Narcotics Anonymous."7:29pm Wednesday 27th October 2004Print   SendPost this story to: Digg | del.icio.us | Furl | reddit | NowPublic | Yahoo!

More Books by Robert Andrew Powell ISBN: 0802141536 All Product Details   Available at:Quimby WarehouseSynopses & Reviews Publisher Comments: Although its participants are still in grade school, Pop Warner football is serious business in Miami, where local teams routinely advance to the national championships. Games draw thousands of fans; recruiters vie for nascent talent; drug dealers and rap stars bankroll teams; and the stakes are so high that games sometimes end in gunshots. In America's poorest neighborhood, troubled parents dream of NFL stardom for children who long only for a week in Disney World at the Pop Warner Super Bowl. In 2001, journalist Robert Andrew Powell spent a year following two teams through roller-coaster seasons. The Liberty City Warriors, former national champs, will suffer the team's first-ever losing season. The Palmetto Raiders, undefeated for two straight years, will be rewarded for good play with limo rides and steak dinners. But their flamboyant coach (the "Darth Vader of youth football") will face defeat in a down-to-the-wire playoff game. We Own This Game is an inside-the-huddle look into a world of innocence and corruption, where every kickoff bares political, social, and racial implications; an unforgettable drama that shows us just what it is to win and to lose in America.back to top What Our Readers Are Saying Be the first to add a comment for a chance to win! back to top Product Details ISBN:0802141536 Author:Powell, Robert Andrew Publisher:Grove Press Author:Powell, Robert Andrew Subject:Football - General Subject:Sports & Recreation - Football Publication Date:September 2004 Binding:Paperback Language:English Pages:208 Dimensions:825x550  back to top Find related books in: Section-Aisle Sports and Fitness - Football General  HelpSecurity and PrivacyShippingMoney Back GuaranteeOrder by PhoneContact UsNewslettersEventsPartner ProgramBlogEmploymentAbout Powell's BooksLaurels! 2005 Best of the WebEPIC Official BooksellerForbes FavoriteSexiest StaffRSS 2.0Log OffCopyright © 1994-2006 Powells.com Terms of Use#*#html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd"#*#Powell's Books - We Own This Game: A Season the in the Adult World of Youth Football by Robert Andrew PowellSkip navigationBrowse SectionsBestsellersNew ArrivalsSaleeBooksGift CardsAdvanced Search   RELATED AISLES Sports and Fitness Football General   RECENTLY VIEWEDNo ItemsRECENTLY VIEWEDRead the original essay by David Treuer and save 30% on The Translation of Dr. Apelles.$16.10Hardcover   $14.00TRADE PAPER, NEW                                              Ships in 1 to 3 days                      Qty StoreSection3 Quimby WarehouseSports and Fitness- Football General                       1 Quimby WarehouseSports and Fitness- Football General                       Hide store locationsClick here to show storeand shelf locations We Own This Game: A Season the in the Adult World of Youth Football    by Robert Andrew Powell  About This Book Synopses & Reviews Comment on this title and you could win free books!

Andrew Powell - Memory Alpha - A Wikia wikiAndrew PowellFrom Memory Alpha, the free Star Trek reference. Andrew Powell.Lieutenant Andrew Powell was a Human Starfleet science officer serving aboard the USS Enterprise-D.He began dating Nurse Alyssa Ogawa in 2370, and their relationship became serious.  Powell joined Ogawa's friends, including Sam Lavelle, in a poker game on at least one occassion.  Sam later said, jokingly, that Powell was probably the worst poker player he had ever seen.  However, Ogawa worried that they were drifting apart after Powell cancelled a date and began putting in overtime on a research proposal.  Dr. Beverly Crusher also saw Powell talking with another woman in Ten Forward.  When Crusher asked Ogawa about the status of their romance out of concern, Ogawa revealed that Powell had proposed to her and that they planned to announce the engagement after the midyear crew evaluations.  (TNG: "Lower Decks")Ogawa became pregnant with their first child soon following their engagement.  Powell was initially shocked, and Lieutenant Commander Data offered to share his insights on parenthood, gained from experiences with Spot. (TNG: "Genesis")A man who was presumably Powell was seen with Alyssa after she lost the baby due to the effects of the temporal anomaly in the anti-time present in TNG: "All Good Things..."  He did not speak and the actor who played him, extra Brian Demonbreun, was not credited for the role.Retrieved from "http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Andrew_Powell"Categories: Humans | Starfleet personnel | USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D) personnel Beta Test A new Search EngineTry out our new search engine and help us make it better.

There’s no substitute for seeing this in theatres, and you can check out a better version over at Xbox.com, but here’s the trailer in some of its glory thanks to the folks at YouTube.com…Also, if you’ve got an Xbox 360, head over to www.halo3.com to sign up for the public beta that will roll in Spring 2007.GATEKeeper @ 1:34 amFiled under: The GATE and Audio/Video Links and Gaming & ElectronicsNo Comments  My Celebrity Look-alikes?         Posted on Tuesday 5 December 2006[Laugh] Check this out - apparently I look like two Matthews, Martin Scorsese, and… who!? GATEKeeper @ 2:33 pmFiled under: GeneralNo Comments  SNL’s Peanuts TV Funhouse         Posted on Sunday 3 December 2006TV Funhouse is one of the few reliably funny things on Saturday Night Live, and in honour of the season upon us I had to post their Charlie Brown Christmas parody that seriously just rocks. Enjoy!GATEKeeper @ 4:37 pmFiled under: General and Audio/Video LinksNo Comments  Edge CASBY fun         Posted on Thursday 23 November 2006Tonight was an interesting little change from the rest of November’s movie barrage - it was Edge 102’s CASBY Awards over at the Kool Haus - an event I’ve missed since Edge started doing it, but finally had a chance to check out this year. It’s one of those events that wants to be its own thing while loosely following the whole performance awards show concept. Considering bands like k-os, Sam Roberts, Evans Blue, and Neverending White Lights were all on hand to perform, it was a pretty cool night.They also tossed in a bit of their charming humour now and then (like the blob of fat affectionatly known as “Meat” appearing in almost all his glory, along with three girls, for the Miss CASBY competition), brought out everyone involved in making Edge rock, and gave out canned goods for awards.And at the end of the night I finally got to meet Dean Blundell too. Practically the first thing out of his mouth was the fact that, well, I didn’t like him very much at all when he started at the Edge. Times change though and now I just think he’s a knob, but even he admits that [laugh]. My only complaint coming out of meeting him was the fact that he called The GATE a blog. A BLOG!? Yuck. I do more than blog on here. Err, don’t I?Okay, so he remembers me but maybe doesn’t know much about the site. I’m still impressed that he remembered me. (I’m actually impessed when anyone actually knows what the site is all about.) I think he was kind of wondering though how I got into the media room [laugh]. Oh well, I do kind of like Dean and the whole morning show now - I just wish they didn’t talk so damn much.Oh, last note - finally got to see what Josie Dye looks like in person and she is as pretty as the Edge folks keep saying. Sadly, I didn’t get a good photo, but that’s the way it goes. Here’s a few of my favorite shots from the night though until I get the gallery online tomorrow.k-osIll ScarlettEvans BlueGATEKeeper @ 1:58 amFiled under: Photography and Festivals & Events and Music & CDs and Toronto2 Comments  New Line has officially lost it         Posted on Monday 20 November 2006New Line has been one of my favorite film companies for years - they’ve been involved in one way or another with some of my all time favorite films - from Evil Dead and Dark City to Pleasantville and well, The Lord of the Rings Trilogy.Over the years I’ve heard a few problems they’ve had, but it didn’t mean much to me. Now though I just can’t understand what they’re thinking. According to Guardian Unlimited New Line has officially ditched Academy-frickin’-Award winning Peter Jackson and Fran Walsh, the people who made Lord of the Rings the success it became, from any future Rings projects.Yep - that includes The Hobbit. I understand that New Line and Jackson/Walsh are fighting right now (apparently New Line is supposed to owe the duo a lot of cash from Rings still), but come on, if the man who just made your film company millions upon millions of dollars wants to do another film - you hand it over. NOW. There’s another side to this - I can pretty much guarantee that the fans are gonna backlash on this, and that any wannabe director you pull in to do future LOTR films is gonna suck, and suck huge.My advice? Settle with Jackson and Walsh, beg for forgiveness, and accept the piles of cash they can make for you at the cost of whatever they want in return.GATEKeeper @ 11:40 pmFiled under: Movies & DVDs and RantsNo Comments  Jakalope still rocks, but…         Posted on Sunday 19 November 2006Look, I’m sorry - I love Jakalope and I think Katie B. rocks (how can you not adore the girl?), but I have to admit that I’m having a hard time getting into the new song/video - “Upside Down (And I Fall)”.I still love Jakalope, and I’m looking forward to the show on December 7 at the Mod Club (go Edge Electric Christmas!), but just as an example check out these two videos - the first is “Upside Down (And I Fall)”, from the new album, and the second one is my favorite, “Feel It” from the first album…“Feel It”GATEKeeper @ 11:36 pmFiled under: Music & CDs and Audio/Video Links and RantsNo Comments  Love those gadgets         Posted on Sunday 19 November 2006I’ve been planning out a holiday gift giving guide to go online next week and I’ve checked out a lot of things from CDs, and DVDs to games, and of course, electronics. The trouble is, I’ve run into a gadget that I love so much, I think I want to run out and buy one now.It’s called the Samsung Sports Camcorder (SC-X210L) and unlike a lot of video cameras I’ve looked at, it actually has some cool features without making it too complicated. It’s pretty much designed for sports enthusiasts who want to record their experiences - and that’s done with an extra lens that you attach to the camera and then either carry or mount on a little pad that you can wear on a hat or on your arm. Very, very cool - plus it acts as an MP3 player, camera, and audio recorder.I’m very, very tempted to go buy one after I return the loaner I’ve got - it would make a great new way to interview folks for the site.GATEKeeper @ 11:13 pmFiled under: The GATE and Gaming & ElectronicsNo Comments  Get in the spirit         Posted on Sunday 19 November 2006Some people, and we’ll call them the scrooges out there, aren’t going to like this, but I’m declaring today the start of this year’s holiday spirit. There was a brief amount of snow falling this morning, the Americans have Thanksgiving this Thursday, and of course here in Toronto we had the Santa Claus Parade. So, in the spirit of the season, here’s a little Christmas video to get you all started - “Do They Know It’s Christmas” by Band-Aid (the original, not the stupid new version):GATEKeeper @ 10:51 pmFiled under: General and Music & CDs and Audio/Video LinksNo Comments  Bond, James Bond         Posted on Tuesday 14 November 2006This week has turned into a bit of a chaotic series of events for me as every company and their dog has planned some sort of media event to promote things before the end of the year. While I’m making time for a little bit of everything the movie screenings have my full attention I’d say.Sunday morning it was Happy Feet, the animated film about penguins, but it ended up being a bit of a disaster mainly because the story was pretty thin. And Wednesday I’ve got the screeening for The Fountain which is this trippy story about the fountain of youth, but told throughout three different periods of time for two people. Plus, there’s Deja Vu very shortly as well.But tonight was the big night in my mind - Sony’s screening for the new Bond film, Casino Royale starring Daniel Craig as James Bond himself.Now a lot of fuss has been made about the fact that Craig doesn’t seem to be a good choice for the role, and on top of that the last few Bond flicks have royally sucked if you ask me, but I’ll admit it - this is a superior Bond film. In the history of Bond films this might even be in my top 5. The style is there, director Martin Campbell does a brilliant job, and you can tell right away that it’s the core of writer Paul Haggis screenplay for the film that makes this such a good movie (I know they toyed with his work a lot, but I’m pretty sure Haggis’ script would have been rather un-Bond-like otherwise - he said in one interview that he took out all the corny jokes!).Stay tuned for a full review of the film and all that, but I can tell you right now that it’s going to be big (FYI - leading Bond girl Eva Green is worth the price of admission, not to mention the killer opening credits).Update: Check out the Casino Royale photo gallery.GATEKeeper @ 12:07 amFiled under: The GATE and Movies & DVDsNo Comments  Cory Lee is “Naughty” again         Posted on Friday 10 November 2006Was just on the set tonight for Cory Lee’s new video for the remix of “The Naughty Song” (which is also going to be on her new album Sinful Innocence - which comes out in February 2007) and thought I’d post a photo of Cory. Had a great time chatting with her, the folks on set, and the choreographers, not to mention the always helpful Holly from Splash Publicity.

The goal of ADEPT is to build a distributed digital library (DL) of personalized collections of geospatially referenced information. This DL is characterized by: (1) services for building, searching, and using personalized collections; (2) collections of georeferenced multimedia information, including dynamic simulation models of spatially distributed processes; and (3) user interfaces employing the concept of a “Digital Earth”. Important near-term objectives for ADEPT are to build prototype collections that support undergraduate learning in physical, human, and cultural geography and related disciplines, and then to evaluate whether using such resources helps students learn to reason scientifically. Collections and services developed by ADEPT researchers will migrate to ADL as they mature.REFERENCESNote: OCR errors may be found in this Reference List extracted from the full text article.

NSDL Whiteboard Report - Full Resource Record Display           Date Of Record Release:2005-02-01 16:11:00Title:NSDL Standing Committee Meetings at JCDLDescription:NSDL Standing Committee Meetings at JCDLThe Educational Impact and Evaluation (EIESC), Content (CSC), and Technology (TSC) Standing Committees met in Denver last week. -The EIESC meeting, chaired by Laura Bartolo, reviewed: 1. CALL for participation in working groups to continue EIESC work throughout the year, as well as to work with other projects sharing similar interests. Please email Anita Coleman (asc@acm.org) or Laura Bartolo (lbartolo@kent.edu) by Thursday, June 30, if you would like to participate in one of the Working Groups listed below, or another that you would like to suggest: -Evaluation Tutorial Workshop at NSDL Annual Meeting 2005 (deadline for proposal is July 10) -2006 Annual Report--Each year EIESC works with other groups on contributing to AR. Carol Minton Morris discussed that the AR Committee looks for ways to demonstrate impact and will disseminate the publication in print andonline version -DLIST Evaluation Clearinghouse: Collaborative effort to build an evaluation materials repository for EIESC Grade Level Vocabularies  2. CALL 2006-2008 Chair and Vice-Chair Nominations Please email Anita Coleman (asc at acm.org) or Laura Bartolo (lbartolo at kent.edu) if you would like to volunteer or nominate individuals for these positions. The term starts in January 2006. Voting will be held at Annual Meeting in November. 3. Additional Discussion for EIESC List: Fall teleconference call, and EIESC meeting at the Annual Meeting: The EIESC will revisit goals to find out where there is energy. Please send your thoughts to the EIESC list [eduimpact-members@comm.nsdl.org]. The fall teleconference will be scheduled in late August to plan for the EIESC meeting at the NSDL Annual Meeting. -The CSC meeting, chaired by Kim Lightle, discussed: 1. A strategy for developing a list of documents (everything from collection development policies to reusability guidelines) that would be useful to collect in one place 2. A process for finding controlled vocabularies that have already been registered. -Robbie Robson, TSC Chair, led the Technology Standing Committee Meeting on Friday morning where he outlined a possible "Plugfest" for the Annual Meeting explaining that a venue for experimentation and demonstration would be an opportunity for developers to cross-fertilize. Response was favorable, but timing and resources are missing to make this happen in conjunction with the Annual Meeting. Could be presented at an additional NSDL event. The TSC would like to: 1. Get a better idea what technologies are being used by NSDL projects. Survey methods were discussed. 2. Explore creating a facility within the poster finder to help developers find others who are presenting complimentary technologies. 3. Give the Annual Meeting Planning committee feedback about what sorts of technical presentations would be useful during the Annual Meeting.Url:http://content.nsdl.org/wbr/Issue.php?issue=76Relation:http://nsdl.org/ofinterest/?ctype=rss&rss;=wbrRelease Flag:OK for ViewingCitation:Whiteboard Report, 76, June 2005, NewsLanguage:EnglishPubType:WBRAudience:UndergraduateGraduateResearchLifelong LearnerFormat:plainResource Type:TextDate Last Modified:2005-06-16 17:31:36Date Of Record Creation:2005-06-16 17:22:20Date Record Checked:1999-11-30© nsdl.org  |  Comments, Suggestions?

FARM CREDIT BANK OF SPOKANE, Larry Coleman, Anita Coleman, Wesley W. Coleman and Vivian Coleman, d/b/a Coleman Ranch, Cross Defendants and Counterdefendants. Bankruptcy No. 86-20140. Adv. No. 289/0018. United States Bankruptcy Court, D. Montana. August 23, 1989. Page 339         Harold V. Dye, Missoula, Mont., for debtors/plaintiffs.         W.

PETERSON, Bankruptcy Judge.         This adversary proceeding was filed by Chapter 12 Debtors to specifically enforce the provisions of a confirmed Chapter 12 Plan against Farm Credit Services, formerly Federal Intermediate Credit Bank (FICB), concerning a Contract for Deed between the Debtors and Defendants Charles F. and Delores A. Bick. After answer, trial of the cause was held on May 2, 1989, and thereafter all parties filed memorandum of authorities in support of their respective positions.         On April 26, 1974, the Debtors entered into an agreement with Charles F. and Delores A. Bick, as sellers, for purchase of certain real property in Lake County, Montana, for the sum of $320,000.00. In 1986, the Debtors sought relief under Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code and listed Bicks as secured creditors. After many procedural maneuvers, particularly involving the Defendant FICB, an Amended Chapter 12 Plan was confirmed by Order of this Court on May 3, 1988. The Plan, filed March 8, 1988, included the following pertinent provisions dealing with payment of the FICB debt and the Bick contract, to-wit:         "2. In addition to the plan payments as set forth above, the Debtors shall transfer to FICB, on confirmation of the plan, all their right, title and interest in the `Bick' and `Cahoon' properties excluding Debtors farmstead and improvements including silage pit and contents and five acres on the Bick property.         (a) The transfer of the real property shall be subject to existing encumbrances for taxes and the contract balance owing on the Bick property. The exact credit to Debtors' indebtedness to FICB depends on the date of confirmation of the plan. However, projecting a confirmation date of April 1, 1988, this would result in a credit of Two Hundred Twenty One Thousand Six Hundred Forty Three and 12/100 Dollars ($221,643.12) to the FICB indebtedness.

ADEPT Collections and Services - Anita ColemanADEPTCollections and ServicesCollections and ServicesModel Description: Develop auser-centric model of ADEPT collections and services. This determinationwill be delivered in the form of a single white paper whose writing willbe coordinated by Ray Smith. The document will have four major sections:AnitaColeman will write an overview and literature review, partly incooperation with DLESE, discussing issues faced by ADEPT in buildingcollections and associated services for learning environments, andpotential resolutions of these issues. This section will serve as afoundation for organizing and building teaching and learningcollections for ADEPT (and subsequent ingestion into ADL) by defining amodel teaching/learning collection. The issues to be discussed include,but are not limited to: definitions of educational collections,different levels of granularity of objects represented in suchcollections and their interrelationships, metadata for educationalobjects and collections, identification of the components andcharacteristics of collections in DLs for use in teaching/learningcontexts, and services available to users for accessing/usingcollection items. It will include concrete examples of ADEPTcollections. TimTierney will write descriptions of four collections and scenariosfor their use in learning environments: geomorphology (with T.Smith and D.Roberts atUCSB, and with an independent effort involving C.Borgmanand UCLA researchers) tectonics (with TBD) spatially distributedhuman processes (with S.Sweeney) religious sites (with B.Holdrege and W.Powell)AnitaColeman will write a section on using simulation models inteaching.

CBS News | Portrait Of A Mexican Drug Lord | October 24, 2003 16:36:56  HomeU.S.IraqWorldPoliticsSciTechHealthWatchEntertainmentOpinionFREE CBS News Video  October 24, 2003 16:36:56  The Early Show    CBS Evening News    48 Hours    60 Minutes    60 Minutes II     All Broadcasts Section FrontE-mail This Story Printable VersionPortrait Of A Mexican Drug LordMEXICO CITY, Oct. 24, 2003House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, U.S. Amb. to Mexico Tony Garza, Davis Hobson (R-OH), Sam Farr (D-CA), Hilda Solis (D-CA), Linda Sanchez (D-CA) at a drug news conference Wed. in Mexico City.  (Photo: AP)"El Mayo is more of the businessman, the guy who wants to cooperate and bring people together." Errol Chavez, DEA(AP) Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, Mexico's new No. 1 drug lord, rose to the top by eliminating rivals, winning over Colombian cocaine producers and evading a 19-month U.S.-Mexico effort to smash his smuggling syndicate, investigators told The Associated Press.Zambada is hardly a household name, yet he has become the most wanted drug smuggler in Mexico and is expected to be added soon to the FBI's Top 10 Most-Wanted Fugitives list, U.S. and Mexican drug agents told AP.Mexico's top anti-drug prosecutor, Jose Santiago Vasconcelos, called Zambada "drug dealer No. 1" and said the fugitive has become more powerful as his fellow kingpins have fallen, including one who was allegedly killed on Zambada's orders."With all the other groups, we have captured the leaders," Vasconcelos said at his heavily guarded Mexico City office. "He's the only leader we haven't caught."Zambada's organization was the target of "Operation Trifecta," a 19-month, U.S.-Mexican sting that ended July 31. Authorities say they collared 240 suspected drug smugglers in the United States and Mexico, seized nearly six tons of cocaine and unsealed U.S. federal indictments against Zambada, his son and his key cocaine distributor.Errol Chavez, head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's Arizona division, said the operation confirmed "the scope of (Zambada's) influence in Mexico is legendary," spanning nearly 30 years.Zambada, the 55-year-old leader of a drug gang based in the Pacific Coast resort city of Mazatlan, has formed alliances with "almost every known drug trafficking group in Mexico," Chavez said.No one knows exactly how much Mexico's drug trade - or Zambada's sizable share of it - are worth, but the White House estimates about half the $65 billion in narcotics that Americans buy each year comes through Mexico.Zambada has been charged with organized crime and drug trafficking in Mexico, and a U.S. indictment charges him with conspiring to smuggle cocaine.Zambada's rise to the top of Mexico's drug ranks began in February 2002, when police in Mazatlan shot and killed Ramon Arellano Felix. The feared enforcer for the Tijuana-based smuggling gang bearing his family's name, Arellano Felix had been on the list of the FBI's 10 most-wanted fugitives.Chavez and U.S. investigators in Mexico City who spoke on the condition of anonymity said Zambada lured Arellano Felix to his home turf and paid the police officers who killed him, although Mexican officials won't confirm that. Zambada has never been charged in the case.Zambada got another boost a month later, when authorities captured Ramon Arellano Felix's brother Benjamin, the Arellano Felix gang's operations chief.The Arellano Felix gang was Mexico's most powerful smuggling syndicate from the late 1990s until the death of Ramon Arellano Felix and the capture of Benjamin Arellano Felix.Many investigators on both sides of the border speculated that no one drug lord would step up and fill the power vacuum left by a weakened Arellano Felix gang.But Chavez said Zambada rose to power by winning the trust of Colombian cocaine producers in a way the Arellano Felix gang never could, allowing his organization to move more cocaine into the United States than most other smuggling syndicates."There were financial problems between the (Arellano Felix organization) and the Colombians," Chavez said, noting that as the Arellano Felix brothers fell, "bills went unpaid and the Colombians sought other trafficking organizations they trusted more.""They sought out El Mayo," he explained.Zambada formed close ties to a Colombian cocaine producing organization believed to be run by twin brothers Miguel and Victor Mejia Munera, U.S. investigators say.Arellano Felix syndicate smugglers still bring tons of cocaine into the United States via Tijuana. Rather than challenge the rival gang's authority between Baja California and California, Zambada has tightened his control of smuggling routes leading from neighboring Sonora state into Arizona, authorities say.Chavez said his office is stationing more DEA agents and informants in Sonora and southernmost Arizona in an effort to further target Zambada's group. The DEA also has received special funding for highway billboards between Tucson and Phoenix featuring a wanted poster of Zambada.Zambada remains a bitter enemy of the Arellano Felix gang, but is close to accused Juarez cartel leader Vicente Carrillo Fuentes and has reached out to Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, a convicted drug lord who escaped from prison and specializes in building drug tunnels under the U.S. border, authorities say."El Mayo is more of the businessman, the guy who wants to cooperate and bring people together," Chavez said. "He and El Chapo are very close. They have helped each other become very successful in Arizona."Originally from Sinaloa state where Mazatlan is located, Zambada got his start as an enforcer and hit man for the Juarez cartel based in the border city of the same name.Investigators can't agree on when he founded his own group of freelance smugglers. Mexico's attorney general's office still listed him as one of the heads of Juarez cartel's operations in Sinaloa as recently as 1998, but Chavez and other DEA officials said Zambada began working to form his own group in Mazatlan more than a decade ago.Mexico has taken out several top drug lords over the past two years. Besides the Arellano Felix brothers, police and soldiers collared Osiel Cardenas, the alleged head of the gulf cartel, in March. Last month, they caught up with Armando Valencia, one of thealleged heads of a drug gang based in the central state of Michoacan.Chavez said the DEA is watching family members Zambada has in the United States, but there's no evidence he has crossed the border. In August, Mexican special agents stormed homes in Sonora state's capital, Hermosillo, arresting one Zambada associate.Chavez said authorities were "one step away from El Chapo and two steps away from El Mayo.""It came down to timing," he said.

Errol Chavez, DEA(AP) Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, Mexico's new No. 1 drug lord, rose to the top by eliminating rivals, winning over Colombian cocaine producers and evading a 19-month U.S.-Mexico effort to smash his smuggling syndicate, investigators told The Associated Press.Zambada is hardly a household name, yet he has become the most wanted drug smuggler in Mexico and is expected to be added soon to the FBI's Top 10 Most-Wanted Fugitives list, U.S. and Mexican drug agents told AP.Mexico's top anti-drug prosecutor, Jose Santiago Vasconcelos, called Zambada "drug dealer No. 1" and said the fugitive has become more powerful as his fellow kingpins have fallen, including one who was allegedly killed on Zambada's orders."With all the other groups, we have captured the leaders," Vasconcelos said at his heavily guarded Mexico City office. "He's the only leader we haven't caught."Zambada's organization was the target of "Operation Trifecta," a 19-month, U.S.-Mexican sting that ended July 31. Authorities say they collared 240 suspected drug smugglers in the United States and Mexico, seized nearly six tons of cocaine and unsealed U.S. federal indictments against Zambada, his son and his key cocaine distributor.Errol Chavez, head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's Arizona division, said the operation confirmed "the scope of (Zambada's) influence in Mexico is legendary," spanning nearly 30 years.Zambada, the 55-year-old leader of a drug gang based in the Pacific Coast resort city of Mazatlan, has formed alliances with "almost every known drug trafficking group in Mexico," Chavez said.No one knows exactly how much Mexico's drug trade - or Zambada's sizable share of it - are worth, but the White House estimates about half the $65 billion in narcotics that Americans buy each year comes through Mexico.Zambada has been charged with organized crime and drug trafficking in Mexico, and a U.S. indictment charges him with conspiring to smuggle cocaine.Zambada's rise to the top of Mexico's drug ranks began in February 2002, when police in Mazatlan shot and killed Ramon Arellano Felix.

U.S. Consulate  -- CALCUTTA, India U.S. EmbassyNEW DELHI  Consulates  CHENNAI MUMBAIContact Us  Privacy Notice HOME     PRESS RELEASES & BRIEFINGS01 June 2004White House Targets 10 International Drug TraffickersU.S. agencies ordered to bar designated kingpins from U.S. economyPresident Bush named 10 international drug traffickers as "kingpins" June 1, initiating a process that aims to bar them, their businesses, and associates from the U.S. economy.A White House press statement designated drug kingpins in Mexico, Jamaica, Peru, India and Afghanistan. This announcement, the fifth of its kind since the law mandating the designation took effect in 2000, brings to 48 the total number of narcotics traffickers targeted by the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act.The statement noted that the kingpin law targets individuals involved in illicit trafficking and does not target their home countries.Following is the text of the White House statement:(begin text)THE WHITE HOUSEOffice of the Press SecretaryJune 1, 2004STATEMENT BY THE PRESS SECRETARYPresidential Designation of Foreign Narcotics KingpinsToday the President designated the fifth annual set of determinations of drug traffickers who will be subject to the sanctions provided in the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act ("Kingpin Act").  This action brings the total number of individuals and entities designated under the Kingpin Act to 48, since the first designations were made in 2000.  This is the second year the President has identified foreign entities as kingpins.This action underscores the President's determination to do everything possible to pursue drug traffickers, undermine their operations, and end the suffering that trade in illicit drugs inflicts on Americans and other people around the world, as well as preventing drug traffickers from supporting terrorists.The Kingpin Act, which became law in December 1999, targets significant foreign narcotics traffickers, their organizations and operatives worldwide, denying them access to the U.S. financial system and all trade and transactions involving U.S. companies and individuals.  The Kingpin Act does not target the countries in which these foreign individuals and entities are operating or the governments of such countries.The additional foreign individuals and entities that the President has designated as appropriate for sanctions under the Kingpin Act are:Arellano Felix Organization  (Mexico)Eduardo Ramon Arellano Felix (Mexico)Francisco Javier Arellano Felix (Mexico)Carrillo Fuentes Organization (Mexico)Armando Valencia Cornelio (Mexico)Norris Nembhard (Jamaica)Leebert Ramcharan (Jamaica)Fernando Melciades Zevallos Gonzales (Peru)Iqbal Mirchi (India)Haji Bashir Noorzai (Afghanistan)The initial list of drug kingpins was released in June 2000, and the names just released are additions to that list.(end text)Sorry, you need a JavaScript capable browser to get the best from this pageSorry, you need a JavaScript capable browser to get the best from this pageSorry, you need a JavaScript capable browser to get the best from this page#*#doctype html public "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"#*#U.S. Consulate  -- CALCUTTA, India U.S. EmbassyNEW DELHI  Consulates  CHENNAI MUMBAIContact Us  Privacy Notice#*# <font size="-1" color="#ffffff">&#149;</font> ><a href="page.html" class="local4">Search</a> <font size="-1" color="#ffffff">&#149;</font><a href="page.html" class="local4">Site Map</a> #*# #*#HOME     PRESS RELEASES & BRIEFINGS01 June 2004White House Targets 10 International Drug TraffickersU.S. agencies ordered to bar designated kingpins from U.S. economyPresident Bush named 10 international drug traffickers as "kingpins" June 1, initiating a process that aims to bar them, their businesses, and associates from the U.S. economy.A White House press statement designated drug kingpins in Mexico, Jamaica, Peru, India and Afghanistan.

Fayette drug agents participate in federal sting to take out Mexican smugglers in Atlanta Sunday, August 31, 2003Fayette drugagents participate in federal sting to take out Mexican smugglers in AtlantaBy JOHNMUNFORDjmunford@TheCitizenNews.comThe FayetteCounty Sheriff's Department's Drug Task Force was lauded Thursday forits participation in a federal drug sting that targeted a Mexican organizationdistributing drugs in the metro Atlanta area. Last week,Fayette drug agents helped arrest 24 suspects and seize $3.1 million incash as over 200 law enforcement officers executed search warrants on19 locations in metro Atlanta last week, said U.S. Attorney William S.Duffey Jr. Authorities confiscated 254 kilograms of cocaine, 500 poundsof marijuana, two pounds of methamphetamine and a half-pound of "ice,"which is liquid methamphetamine. The Fayettedrug agents played a crucial role in the sting, particularly with surveillanceoperations, said W. Michael Furgason, Sr., special agent in charge ofthe Drug Enforcement Administration. "They'rea great narcotics team and they bring a lot of experience we rely on,"Furgason said. "It's just that they're good cops." Fayette CountySheriff Randall Johnson said the bust was one of the biggest the departmenthas ever participated in. "It'sthe opportunity of a lifetime to be in on a drug bust this size,"Johnson said. The 24 suspectshave all been charged in federal court with conspiring to distribute andsell drugs in the area, Duffey said. Most of those arrested were immigrantsliving illegally in the country, Furgason added. The bust wasannounced at a news conference in Atlanta Thursday morning. Although noneof the drug activity took place in Fayette County, Sheriff Johnson saidit is important to help cut drug trafficking in the area before they aredistributed here. "We wantthem (criminals) to know they'd better not come in here with it,"Johnson said. "They know where the county line is now." The FayetteCounty Drug Task Force is comprised of agents from the Fayette CountySheriff's Department, the Tyrone Police Department and the Pike CountySheriff's Department. Duffey saidthe Armando Valencia organization would import the drugs from Mexico andstash them in large vehicles such as tractor trailers for transport intocities like Atlanta. As the 18-monthinvestigation continued, it became more apparent that the Valencia organizationwas very dangerous, Duffey said. When the search warrants were servedby officers early one morning, one suspect was found sleeping next toa gun, Duffey said. Anyone whosleeps with a weapon within arm's reach "is prepared to use it whenit has to be used," Duffey noted. "Theseare professional dealers," Furgason said. Although noconnections could be made to the Valencia organization, federal drug agentshave learned that many unsolved homicides are tied to drug traffickingin general. Authoritiesdecided to target the Valencia organization because "it was the onewe knew the least about," Duffey said. The investigation revealedthe gang was very sophisticated in its operations, particularly in theamount of time they spent trying to learn about law enforcement techniques.Members ofthe Valencia organization would spend as much time doing that counterintelligenceas they would actually selling the drugs, Duffey noted. The goal ofthe operation was to "dismantle" the Valencia organization,Duffey said. The head of the organization, Armando Valencia himself, wasarrested in Mexico with cooperation from authorities there, Duffey said.The drugs wouldtravel from Reynosa, Mexico to McAllen, Tex., to Atlanta and beyond toKnoxville, Tenn., Furgason said. Officers founddrugs in four metro Atlanta locations, at residences in Lilburn, Smyrna,Norcross and Roswell, authorities said. Although Duffeyrefused to go into details about what agents learned about the Valenciaorganization or how the investigation was conducted, he said agents usedjust about every investigative tactic in the book.

DEA - Publications - Congressional Testimony - 03/21/00Statement by:Donnie R. MarshallActing AdministratorDrug Enforcement AdministrationUnited States Department of Justice Before the:Senate Drug Caucus on International Narcotics Control Date:March 21, 2000 Note: This document may not reflect changes made in actual delivery. Chairman Grassley, Members of the Senate. I appreciate this opportunityto appear before the Committee today to discuss the issue of Certificationand U.S. Counter narcotics efforts. I would like first to thank the Committeefor its continued support of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)and overall support of drug law enforcement. As all of you are aware, DEA is first and foremost a law enforcementagency. Although the certification process has proved to be an effectivediplomatic tool relative to the international antidrug effort, as a matterof policy, DEA does not make recommendations relative to certification.Each year, DEA provides the Attorney General with an objective assessmentof the drug trafficking situation for a country based upon evidence andfactual information. DEA's analysis of counter-narcotics efforts by anothercountry does not include an opinion on whether a country should or shouldnot be certified. We merely present the facts to U.S. policy makers andallow them to make an informed decision on the certification of a respectivecountry. As such, my comments today will be limited to an objective assessmentof the law enforcement issues involved with drug trafficking. As part of the submitted written testimony, I have also included thedrug trafficking assessment reports of several countries which were recentlyevaluated and either decertified or granted a waiver due to vital U.S.interests. These countries include Afghanistan, Burma, Cambodia, Paraguay,Nigeria, and Haiti. Due, however, to the magnitude of the threat drug traffickerspose to the national security of both countries, along with the strategicimportance to the United States, I will direct much of today's testimonyon Mexico. As many of you know, criminal organizations based in Mexico pose thegreatest challenge to U.S. law enforcement agencies charged with enforcingnarcotics laws. Due to the ever-increasing legitimate cross-border trafficand commerce between the U.S. and Mexico, several international organizedcrime groups have established elaborate smuggling infrastructures on bothsides of the U.S./Mexico border. Furthermore, it has long been establishedthat in addition to drug trafficking, these international criminal organizationsspawn violence, corruption, and intimidation that threaten the safety andstability of our cities and towns across America. The complex and sophisticated international drug trafficking groupsoperating out of Mexico are oftentimes vicious, destructive entities, thatoperate on a global scale. The largest drug trafficking organizations inMexico --- operating out of Guadalajara, Juarez, Mexicali, Tijuana, Sonora,and the Gulf region --- under the auspices of Vicente Carrillo-Fuentes,Armando Valencia-Cornelio, Miguel Caro-Quintero, Ramon and Benjamin Arellano-Felix,and Osiel Cardenas-Guillen are in many ways, the modern versions of themob leaders and groups that U.S. law enforcement has fought against sincethe beginning of last century. These international organized crime leaders,however, are far more dangerous, far more influential, and have a greaterimpact on our day-to-day lives than did their domestic predecessors. Those international traffickers and their organizations make operationaldecisions from places like Sonora, Mexico, and other locations outsideU.S. borders, which detrimentally affect the quality of life of our citizensand directly support drug-related crime in cities and towns across ourcountry. These groups have reached new levels of sophistication and havebecome a threat not only to the United States and Europe, but also to theirown countries. Their power and influence are unprecedented. Unless innovative,flexible, multi-faceted responses are crafted, these drug trafficking organizationsthreaten to grow even more powerful in the years to come. The Damage to the United States:In order to understand the extent and nature of the damage caused byinternational drug trafficking organizations, it is crucial to look athow these organizations work, and how they infiltrate and position themselvesin U.S. communities in order to further their goals. On any given day in the United States, business transactions are beingarranged between the major drug lords headquartered in Mexico and theirsurrogates who have established roots within the United States, for theshipment, storage, and distribution of tons of illicit drugs. In the past,Mexico-based criminal organizations limited their activities to the cultivationof marijuana and opium poppies for subsequent production of marijuana andheroin. The organizations were also relied upon by Colombian drug lordsto transport loads of cocaine into the United States, and to pass on thiscocaine to other organizations who distributed the product throughout theU.S. However, over the past several years, Mexico-based organized crimesyndicates have gained increasing control over many of the aspects of thecocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, and marijuana trades, resulting in increasedthreats to the well-being of American citizens as well as government institutionsand the citizens of their own country. In the recent past, traffickers from Mexico had maintained dominancein the western part of the United States, and in some Midwest cities. Today,the Drug Enforcement Administration, along with other law enforcement agencies,has developed evidence leading to indictments demonstrating that associatesof organized crime groups based in Mexico have established themselves onthe East Coast of the United States, thus becoming significant participantsin the nationwide drug trade. Mexican Traffickers Rise to Prominence:During 1995 and 1996, intense law enforcement pressure was focused onthe Cali leadership by the brave men and women of the Colombian NationalPolice. As a result, all of the top trafficking leaders from Cali wereeither jailed or killed. During that time frame, U.S. law enforcement agencieswere effectively attacking Colombian cells operating within the UnitedStates. With the Cali leaders imprisoned in Colombia and the successfulattacks by law enforcement on their U.S. cells, traffickers from Mexicotook on greater prominence. A growing alliance between the Colombian traffickersand the organizations from Mexico worked to benefit both sides. Traffickersfrom Mexico had long been involved in smuggling marijuana, heroin, andcocaine across the U.S.-Mexico border, using established distribution routesto deliver drugs throughout the United States. The Mexico-based organizations'emergence as major methamphetamine producers and traffickers also contributedto making them a major force in international drug trafficking. The Mexicantraffickers, who were previously paid in cash by the Colombian traffickersfor their services, began to routinely receive up to one-half of a shipmentof cocaine as their payment. This led to Mexican traffickers having accessto multi-ton quantities of cocaine and allowed them to expand their marketsand influence in the United States, thereby making them formidable cocainetraffickers in their own right. With the disruption of the Cali syndicate, Mexican groups such as theAmado Carrillo-Fuentes organization, the Arellano-Felix cartel, the Amezcua-Contrerasbrothers, and the Caro-Quintero group, consolidated their power and beganto dominate drug trafficking along the U.S.-Mexican border and in manyU.S. cities. Recent events in Mexico and along the southwest border emphasizethe fact that trafficking groups from Mexico have developed into a significantforce in international organized crime. Overview of Narcotics Smuggled along the U.S.-Mexican Border:Recent estimates indicate that approximately 55% of the cocaine availablein the United States is transported across the U.S.-Mexico border. Typically,large cocaine shipments are transported from Colombia, via commercial shipping,fishing and "go-fast" boats and off-loaded in Mexico. The cocaine is transportedthrough Mexico, usually by trucks, where it is warehoused in cities likeGuadalajara, Tijuana or Juarez, that are operating bases for the majorcriminal trafficking organizations. The extremely high volume of vehiculartraffic over the U.S./Mexico border allows cocaine loads to be driven acrossthe border and taken to major distribution centers within the U.S., suchas Los Angeles, New Jersey, Chicago, or Phoenix. Surrogates of the majordrug lords wait for instructions, often provided over sophisticated communicationsdevices--phones, faxes, pagers or computers--telling them where to warehousesmaller loads, who to contact for transportation services, and to whomto return the eventual profits. Individuals sent to the United States fromMexico, often illegally, have been shown to have contracted with U.S. truckingestablishments to move loads across the country. Once the loads arrivein an area that is close to the eventual terminal point, safehouses areestablished for workers who watch over the cocaine supplies and arrangefor it to be distributed by wholesale dealers within the vicinity. Thesedistributors have traditionally been Colombian nationals or individualsfrom the Dominican Republic, but recently, DEA has come upon evidence thatMexican trafficking organizations are also directly involved in cocainedistribution in New York City. We have not only identified the drug lords themselves, but in most cases,the key members of their command and control structure. The combined effortsof the DEA, FBI, DOJ, the U.S. Customs Service, and members of state andlocal police departments have resulted in the seizure of hundreds of tonsof drugs, hundreds of millions of dollars in drug proceeds, and most importantly,several significant indictments. In fact, some of the leaders of theseorganizations - Ramon and Benjamin Arellano-Felix, Luis and Jesus Amezcua-Contreras,Vicente Carrillo-Fuentes - have become familiar names in every major lawenforcement department in the United States. Despite this evidence, alongwith the notoriety, these traffickers have continued to evade arrest andprosecution. The primary reason they have been able to avoid arrest and continuetheir criminal enterprise is their ability to intimidate witnesses andassassinate and corrupt public officials. Clear examples of this pointmay be cited in recent efforts to apprehend members of the Arellano Felixcartel and the Cardenas Guillen cartel, based in Tijuana and Matamoros,Mexico, respectively. In Tijuana over the past year, Mexican officials,have not been able to apprehend key traffickers working for the ArellanoFelix organization. In November 1999, major Gulf cartel drug traffickerOsiel Cardenas Guillen illegally detained and assaulted two U.S. drug enforcementagents in Matamoros, Mexico, across the international border from Brownsville,Texas. Methamphetamine traffickers, oftentimes associated with major Mexicanorganized crime groups, obtain the precursor chemicals necessary for methamphetamineproduction from sources in other countries, such as China and India, aswell as from rogue chemical suppliers in the United States. In fact, Mexico-basedtransnational criminal organizations have become the most significant distributorsin the U.S. of methamphetamine and its precursor chemicals. Several bulkephedrine seizures destined for Mexico have focused attention on the magnitudeof ephedrine acquisition by Mexican organized crime groups. Methamphetaminesuper labs, capable of producing hundreds of pounds of methamphetamineon a weekly basis, are established in Mexico or in California, where themethamphetamine is provided to traffickers to distribute across the UnitedStates. Heroin from Mexico now represents 14% of the heroin seized in the UnitedStates by federal authorities, and it is estimated that 43 metric tonsof opium gum was produced in 1999 in Mexico. A recent study conducted bythe DEA indicates that as much as 29% of the heroin being used in the U.S.is being smuggled in by the Mexico-based organized crime syndicates. Mexicanblack tar heroin is produced in Mexico, and transported over the borderin cars and trucks. Like cocaine and methamphetamine, it is traffickedby associates of the organized criminal groups in Mexico, and providedto dealers and users in the Southwest, Northwest, and Midwest areas ofthe United States. At one time, it was commonplace for couriers to carrytwo pounds or so of heroin into the United States; recently, quantitiesof heroin seized from individuals have increased as is evidenced by largerseizures in a number of towns in Texas. This heroin is extremely potent,and its use has resulted in a significant number of deaths. Marijuana from Mexico still dominates the illicit U.S. import marketalthough U.S. experts estimate Mexico's marijuana production at 3,700 metrictons (compared with 4,600 in 1998 and 4,800 in 1997). In addition, during1999, the GOM eradicated some 23,547 hectares of marijuana (down from 24,200in 1998). Seizures of Mexican marijuana have increased from 102 metrictons in 1991 to 836.3 metric tons in 1999. Marijuana organizations fromMexico are very powerful and violent. In some places, traffickers fromMexico have established marijuana cultivation operations within the UnitedStates. In a recent case in Idaho, DEA , working with other Federal, state,and local law enforcement officials, arrested a group of illegal aliensfrom Zacatecas, Mexico. A total of 114,000 marijuana plants, weighing almost20 tons, was seized. This operation represented the largest marijuana seizureever in the state of Idaho. It is important to note that although many of the transactions relatingto the drug trade take place on U.S. soil, the major organized crime bossesdirect each and every detail of their multi-billion dollar business whilesituated in Mexico. They are responsible not only for the business decisionsbeing made, but also ultimately for the devastation that many Americancommunities have suffered as a result of the influx of cocaine, methamphetamine,heroin, and marijuana. These powerful and organized syndicates can frustratethe ability of the Mexican anti-drug police. Their ability to place obstaclessuch as corruption and unlimited resources in the path of police can oftentimesimpede investigations. In the past year, none of the major Mexican traffickingorganizations have been dismantled or significantly disrupted by Mexicanauthorities. Law Enforcement Response:Reporting indicates that the Southwest border (SWB) remains a majorpoint of entry for approximately 70% of all illicit drugs smuggled intoour country by Mexican trafficking groups. In response to this continuedthreat along the border, the DEA has established several initiatives thatfacilitate and improve intelligence and information sharing, while identifyingand removing impediments to cooperation. These initiatives employ a multi-prongedstrategy, which utilizes and combines law enforcement operations, intelligenceoperations, and provides for law enforcement assistance in order to achievesuccess in combating criminal drug trafficking organizations along theborder. The objective of these initiatives is to disrupt and ultimatelydismantle criminal organizations that smuggle illicit drugs into the U.S.by linking Federal, state and local investigations domestically and mobilizingmultilateral enforcement efforts abroad. Based upon past trends, intelligence,and recent seizures along the border, the DEA has established the followingpriorities for the SWB Field Divisions: (1) cocaine investigations involvingviolent organizations; (2) methamphetamine investigations, (3) heroin investigations,(4) marijuana investigations, (5) money laundering investigations and (6)diverted/dangerous drug and chemical investigations. Enforcement Operations/Strategies:In response to the emergence of these Mexican Drug Trafficking Organization's(MDTO), it became apparent that a coordinated strategy for law enforcementcounterdrug activities needed to be implemented. In order to combat drugproduction and trafficking networks operating along the U.S./Mexican border,DEA, in concert with other Federal agencies, established the SouthwestBorder Initiative - an integrated, coordinated law enforcement effort designedto attack the command and control structure of organized criminal operationsassociated with the Mexican Federation. This strategy focuses on intelligenceand enforcement efforts which target drug distribution systems within theU.S. and directs resources toward the disruption of those principal drugtrafficking organizations operating across the border. As such, DEA, in cooperation with other Federal, state, and local lawenforcement agencies is focusing increased intelligence, technical resources,and investigative expertise on the major MDTO's responsible for smugglingvast quantities of cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamine acrossthe border. Apart from this effort, DEA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation(FBI) also provide assistance in the form of operational planning, intelligence,and training to Government of Mexico (GOM) law enforcement authorities,to strengthen their capacity to combat these organizations. The SouthwestBorder strategy targets specific Mexican trafficking organizations operatingacross the border and attacks their command and control infrastructureswherever they operate. Further, the Special Operations Division (SOD) is a joint national coordinatingand support entity comprised of agents, analysts, and prosecutors fromDOJ, Customs, FBI, DEA and IRS. Its mission is to coordinate and supportregional and national criminal investigations and prosecutions againsttrafficking organizations that most threaten the U.S. SOD performs seamlesslyacross both investigative agency and district jurisdictional boundaries,providing field offices with necessary support, assistance, intelligenceanalysis and "leads" for investigative action. Within SOD, no distinctionis made among the participating investigative agencies. Where appropriate,state and local authorities are fully integrated into coordinated operations.As presently configured, SOD consists of five sections; each of which hasboth DEA, FBI, and USCS personnel assigned. One section targets ColombianTrafficking Organizations, a second concentrates on cocaine and herointrafficking in Europe and Asia, a third targets money laundering organizations,and the remaining two sections are the heart of the Southwest Border Projectand focus their efforts on the principal MDTO's. These two sections target,among other things, the command and control networks of the identifiedMDTO's, and their supporting organizations operating along the Southwestborder. As such, the interagency regional objectives are as follows; (1)Intelligence collection and analysis, (2) Investigations, (3) Interdictionand Enforcement and (4) Prosecution and Incarceration. The following operationdelineates the need and significance for such a multi-agency project: Operation Impunity:In September 1999, the DEA announced the conclusion of a two-year internationalinvestigation that culminated in the arrest of over 106 individuals linkedto the Amado Carrillo Fuentes (ACF) drug trafficking organization, headquarteredin Cancun, Mexico. This investigation, known as "Operation Impunity," wasa multi-jurisdictional, multi-agency investigation which directly linkeddrug trafficking activity in the United States to the highest level ofthe Mexican cocaine trade. This investigation began in January 1998 and was conducted jointly bythe DEA, FBI, USCS, U.S. Attorneys' Offices, DOJ/Criminal Division, anda host of state and local law enforcement agencies. The investigation encompassed53 DEA, FBI, and USCS case investigations which spans 14 Federal judicialdistricts. Since 1998, this investigation has resulted in 36 seizures,netting 12,434 kilograms of cocaine, a half a kilo of heroin, 4,806 poundsof marijuana, more than $19 million in U.S. currency, and the arrest of106 individuals. The above statistics only tell part of the story. Operation Impunitydemonstrated an unparalleled coordinated and cooperative effort among thelaw enforcement community. Overall, this investigation allowed the lawenforcement community to ascertain this organization's method of operationfrom the narcotic distribution in Colombia to the transportation throughMexico to the ultimate distribution networks throughout the U.S. Such successclearly demonstrates the need for the continuation of long term, multi-agencyinvestigations. Cooperative Efforts with the Government of Mexico/Status of VettedUnits:Subsequent to the arrest of General Gutierrez Rebollo in 1997 and theestablishment of mechanisms within the Mexican law enforcement infrastructure,such as the Bilateral Task Forces (BTFs) and the Vetted Unit program, DEAbecame cautiously optimistic relative to the prospects of the GOM's commitmentto bilateral investigations. The DEA has supported these programs financiallyand with other resources in hope that our efforts would result in a successfulattack against the drug lords who are creating so much havoc throughoutcommunities in the United States. However, continuing reports of corruptionand the rapidly growing power and influence of the major organized criminalgroups in Mexico cause us great concern about the long-term prospects forsuccess. Perhaps the arrest of Operation Impunity target Jaime AguilarGastelum and Operation Millennium target Guillermo Moreno-Rios, by Mexicanauthorities, is indicative of the GOM's future commitment to such jointventures. However, in the last year the Vetted Units Program in Mexico has notachieved the potential as originally envisioned by both governments. Inorder to address this issue, the DEA and the Government of Mexico's equivalentto the DEA, the Fiscalia Especializada Para la Atencion de Delitos Contrala Salud (FEADS), have agreed to carefully review the Program and establishways to improve its efficiency and effectiveness against mutually agreedinvestigative targets. The DEA also provides support and assistance tothe FEADS to conduct investigative endeavors throughout Mexico. These investigationsare being conducted with the primary investigative component of the FEADSvetted units - the Bilateral Task Forces (BTF's). Unfortunately, the investigative achievements by the BTF and the SensitiveInvestigations Unit (SIU) as related to cases against the major drug traffickingorganizations are minimal. The inability of these units to fully employthe new investigative techniques and authorities provided in the OrganizedCrime Law to investigate these major organizations has been equally disappointing.Further complicating investigative efforts, the Mexico City-based SIU wascompromised in February 1999 by a Mexican news exposé describingthe operations of that unit, to include its location, activities, and investigativetargets. Because of this setback, the SIU has been largely shut down. Inaddition, throughout 1999 police personnel from the Mexico City SIU wereseparated into smaller groups and often deployed to various regions throughoutMexico in order to work other investigations, such as the search for Mexicofugitive and former Governor of the State of Quintana Roo Mario Villanueva-Madrid. On a positive note, vetted unit personnel of the Organized Crime Unit(OCU), of which the SIU is a part, have been investigating a drug smugglingnetwork of the Carrillo-Fuentes organization in Cancun, headed by AlcidesRamon-Magana. During the course of this investigation, DEA has shared threeprincipal witnesses with the OCU who have provided information regardingthis organization . The information gleaned from these witnesses has contributedto the seizure of real estate in Quintana Roo and the arrest of severaldefendants in this case, including mid-level drug trafficker and money-laundererCarlos Colin-Padilla. In addition, the GOM issued arrest warrants for atotal of 44 individuals associated with Ramon-Magana including an arrestwarrant issued on April 5, 1999, against former Governor Villanueva Madridon 28 counts of drug related offenses. The governments of Mexico and the United States will continue to workcooperatively on investigations. Just this month, based upon informationprovided by the DEA to the GOM, two such operations were conducted, resultingin the seizure of a cocaine laboratory and a methamphetamine laboratoryin Mexico. Ultimately, DEA believes that the vetting process is our bestchance at ensuring integrity with our counterparts. As mentioned in previoustestimony today with respect to the ongoing bilateral Vetted Units Programsurvey, DEA will remain actively engaged with our GOM counterparts relativeto this process. DEA will also encourage the GOM to fully staff and supportthe BTFs and the SIUs with FEADS personnel that have already been vettedand to supply the resources that these operations require. Corruption Issues:Although the Mexican government is attempting to address the issue ofcorruption, it continues to be a serious problem in Mexican law enforcementinstitutions. The Federal Preventive Police (FPP) was created in early1999 in response to the existing corruption in the police ranks, but recentlyreported that several FPP agents were under investigation for corrupt activities.In December 1999 the Government of Mexico/PGR reported that between April1997 through 1999 more than 1,400 of the 3,500 federal police officershad been fired for corruption and that 357 of the officers had been prosecuted.Additionally, the National Public Safety System established a nationalpolice registry to prevent corrupt police officials from being rehiredby another law enforcement entity. However, the PGR has not fully implementedthese programs to deal with corruption. For example, in 1999, the formerDirector of Investigations for the PGR's SIU and OCU, Cuauhtemoc HerreraSuastegui, was reassigned to a high-level position within the PGR despitefailing polygraph examination in 1998. Although several FEADS vetted "floater"units have had several successes during 1999, the Vetted Unit Program failedto adhere to internal security principles involving the polygraph process,which may lead to potential compromises and corruption. The Mexican militaryalso has experienced narco-related corruption within its ranks. As of July 1999, an amendment to the Judicial Organic law mandated thatPGR officers, prosecutors, police agents, experts, and pilots assignedto narcotics eradication duties are required to undergo an evaluation process,to include background checks and polygraphs. Judicial efforts to stop corruption are also underway. On January 11,2000, a Mexican Federal judge issued an arrest warrant for the magistratewho wrongly freed Adan Amezcua-Contreras, a major methamphetamine trafficker. Perhaps the most alarming incident involving Mexican officials occurredon November 9, 1999, when a DEA Special Agent, along with a FBI SpecialAgent debriefed a Confidential Source in Matamoros, Mexico. During thecourse of this debriefing the Special Agents and Confidential Source weresurrounded and physically threatened by Mexican trafficker Osiel Cardenas-Guillenand approximately 15 associates. Each of these associates, one brandishinga gold-plated automatic assault weapon, were either municipal or statepolice officers. Furthermore, despite monitoring the entire incident overthe DEA Special Agent's cellular telephone, which had been used to callfor assistance, the Tamaulipas State Judicial Police Commander took noaction. Due in large part to their resourcefulness and ability to diffusethis dangerous situation, were the agents and the confidential source ableto survive unscathed. Among other issues, this incident highlights thevulnerability of DEA and FBI Special Agents working in Mexico. Status of Extraditions:The principal leaders of major drug trafficking organizations fear thethreat of extradition to the United States more than any other law enforcementor judicial tool. Extradition of significant traffickers ensures that thoseresponsible for the command and control of illicit activities, includingdrug smuggling and money laundering, will be held totally accountable fortheir actions and serve a prison sentence commensurate with their crimes. No major drug traffickers were extradited to the United States in 1999.The Mexican Government did extradite 10 fugitives on narcotics relatedor money laundering offenses in 1999 -- eight U.S. citizens and two Mexicancitizens. One Mexican citizen, a drug trafficker, was sought on drug chargesafter escaping from a U. S. prison while serving a sentence on drug relatedcrimes. The other Mexican citizen, who killed a United States Border Patrolagent, was sought on murder and marijuana smuggling charges. In September 1998, the Government of Mexico arrested U.S. Citizen andDEA fugitive Randall Jeffrey Spradling in Guadalajara which, given Spradling'sstrong ties to both Mexican and Colombian drug traffickers, was an importantevent. He is fighting extradition to the United States. In the past twelve months, some Mexican Courts have denied extraditionof significant drug traffickers, such as Jaime Ladino-Avila, to the U.S.due to a variety of reasons, such as a very dated legal precedent holdinglife imprisonment unconstitutional in Mexico. At the end of 1999, therewere approximately 40 persons in Mexican custody and subject to extraditionproceedings based on U.S. provisional arrest warrants and extradition requests. Conclusion: The Road Ahead:The United States' long experience with confronting and dismantlingorganized criminal activity has necessitated the development of an aggressive,cohesive, and coordinated strategy to identify, target, arrest, and incapacitatethe leadership of these organizations. DEA's role in addressing the drugproblem is to continue to attack the leadership of these internationalcriminal organizations. With a strategy consisting of mounting attackson the organizational command and control of major Mexican traffickingsyndicates that operate along the U.S./Mexico border, the DEA is able toattack the ability of these organizations to conduct business and impedetheir efforts to import drugs into the U.S. The effectiveness of national and bilateral efforts against drug organizationswill depend largely on demonstrable progress in disrupting and dismantlingthese transnational narco-trafficking organizations. This includes apprehending,prosecuting and convicting major drug traffickers, as well as exercisingextradition laws against those defendants facing federal drug traffickingcharges in the United States, and exposing and prosecuting individualsand businesses involved in providing critical support networks such asfront companies, security, transportation and the like.Therefore, it is imperative for law enforcement to continue to facilitatethe flow of information and intelligence while identifying and removingimpediments to cooperation. In this vein, it is vital for the DEA, alongwith other USG agencies, to continue to support the GOM in the field ofcounternarcotics operations. In turn, DEA encourages and expects the GOMto provide adequate investigative manpower, ongoing integrity testing,financial resources, equipment and reciprocal drug intelligence in supportof bilateral drug law enforcement, which should significantly improve bothgovernments' ability to counter and eliminate transnational drug traffickingorganizations. However, the true sign of success regarding anti-drug efforts in Mexicois best recognized with tangible results from concerted law enforcementefforts, i.e. the arrest and successful prosecution of significant leadersof these major drug cartels in Mexico and; where applicable, their extraditionto the United States to face federal drug trafficking charges. We are notyet there. Part II:As an addendum to the drug trafficking assessment on Mexico, includedare abbreviated drug situation reports on six countries. These countrieswere selected due to the Administration's recent announcement either decertifying(Afghanistan and Burma) or certifying due to vital U.S. interests ( Haiti,Paraguay, Cambodia, and Nigeria). These reports include criteria and guidelinesthat may be evaluated during the certification process. Paraguay:Paraguay's primary role in the cocaine trade is as a transit country.Traffickers send shipments of Bolivian cocaine HCl and base through Paraguayinto Brazil and Argentina for further shipment to the United States andEurope. Recent information also indicates that there is some traffickingof cocaine essential chemicals from Paraguay into Bolivia. Paraguayan cocaine traffickers serve primarily as facilitators for majorBolivian and Brazilian cocaine organizations. Paraguayan transportationgroups have, on occasion, provided aircraft and pilots to transportationgroups operating between Peru, Brazil, and Colombia. A common exchangemethod for Paraguayan traffickers is to trade luxury cars stolen in Asuncionand Argentina for Bolivian cocaine. This makes the capital for large cocainepurchases relatively easy to obtain and allows Bolivian traffickers tolaunder their profits directly into tangible assets. Counter-drug efforts in Paraguay are consolidated under the directionof the Secretariat Nacional Antidrogas (SENAD), a Federal agency with nationalauthority to propose legislation, conduct anti-drug education programs,control the diversion of chemicals and drugs, and to conduct drug investigationsand operations, including eradication efforts. In February 2000 RetiredArmy Colonel Hugo Ibarra was appointed as the director of SENAD. In spiteof continuing political turmoil within the government, Ibarra has displayedsome willingness to conduct investigations into drug trafficking and hascooperated with the DEA in mainly low level investigations. The Anti-Narcotics Directorate of the Paraguayan National Police (DINAR)is a full-time investigative unit consisting of approximately 100 policespecial agent personnel. DINAR is controlled organizationally and financiallyby SENAD. The DEA Asuncion Country Office (ACO) utilizes both organizationsto conduct investigations and operations. The formation of a DEA-sponsoredinvestigation/intelligence unit within the DINAR has enhanced the abilityof the ACO to conduct more sensitive investigations and to properly trainand equip this smaller and more secure unit. A criminal code promulgated in 1997 went into effect in November of1998. The new code provided sentencing guidelines for money launderingoffenses. Asset seizures are also provided for under Paraguayan law, butthe law is very new and has only been minimally used. In 1998, the Governmentof Paraguay signed an extradition treaty with the United States, whichincludes a provision for the extradition of nationals. The government alsodrafted legislation that explicitly authorizes undercover operations andcontrolled deliveries. Due to the political instability in Paraguay theproposed legislation remains pending. Burma:In 1999, Burma was named as the world's number two producer of opiumbehind Afghanistan. The 1999 CNC Opium Yield Survey, conducted jointlywith US and Burmese officials estimated the 1999 potential opium yieldto be 1,090 metric tons. This reflects a 38% decrease from 1998 surveyestimates of 1,750 metric tons. In February 2000, the CNC, Embassy andHost Nation officials conducted the 2000 Opium Yield Survey with the DEAas an accompanied observer. Burma continues to be a major producer of both heroin and methamphetamine.Burma accounts for approximately 80 percent of the total production ofSoutheast Asian opium. In 1999, the Government of Burma (GOB) seized 273kilograms of heroin, down from 490 kilograms in 1998. The decrease in seizuresis partly due to opium crop reduction, directly attributed to severe droughtconditions. Also attributed is the response by the GOB against narcotictraffickers, in response to intelligence information provided by DEA. Theincreased enforcement activity on behalf of the GOB has resulted in thetraffickers' utilization of smaller and highly mobile opium refineries. In 1999, the GOB seized in approximately 28.8 million tablets (approximately2,880 kilograms) of methamphetamine. During 1998, the GOB seized 16 milliontablets (approximately 1,600 kilograms). Additionally, in 1999, the GOBsseized 6.43 metric tons of ephedrine. The GOB continues to pursue additionalephedrine smuggling investigations. Methamphetamine produced in Burma is shipped almost exclusively to Thailand.The largest and most recent reported seizure in Thailand was 4.3 milliontablets (approx. 430 kilograms) on March 14, 2000. There have been sixreported seizures of Burmese produced methamphetamine, ranging from 200to 7,800 tablets among the Hmong and Mien communities residing in California. The United States Government policy towards Burma continues to linkpolitical change toward democracy and human rights issues with the narcoticsproblem. Currently minimal assistance is provided to Burma by the U.S.largely through assistance to law enforcement operations and to intelligencesharing by DEA with host government counterparts. Training, utilizing INLfunds, has been prohibited since 1989. The DEA Rangoon Country Office (RCO) has developed a working relationshipwith their Host Nation Counterparts (Directorate of Defense Services Intelligence/DDSI and State Peace and Development Council/SPDC). Intelligence indicates that corruption is rampant in Burma. This situationhas led to petty graft and corruption. However, the government has takenpositive steps to solve this problem by aggressively prosecuting and punishingviolators determined to be involved in corrupt practices. Cambodia:The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) enjoys a good relationshipwith the Cambodian National Police and the National Police Anti-Drug Unit.The Anti-Drug Unit is unable to carry out any type of sophisticated investigationdue to the lack of financial resources, extreme shortage of trained personneland lack of adequate investigative equipment. Cambodia is not a major producer of narcotics although large amountsof marijuana are cultivated with multi-ton quantities being exported toEurope. Marijuana production and trafficking is not considered to be amajor threat to the United States. In 1997, enforcement efforts resultedin the disruption and dismantling of a group of Americans identified tobe sending multi ton quantities of marijuana from Cambodia to the WestCoast of the U.S. The investigation resulted in the arrest of several ofits members and the seizure of approximately six tons of marijuana in Cambodiain June of that year. U.S. and Cambodian defendants were subsequently indictedin the U.S. Despite the fact that Cambodia has no extradition treaty withthe U.S., the Cambodian government deported the above defendants to theU.S. to stand trial. Through a cooperative effort, the Government of Cambodia(GOC) allowed DEA agents to interview the defendant's prior to their deportationto the U.S. In addition to the above, the GOC allowed two of their officersto travel to the U.S. and testify in a U.S. Federal Court. There is little hard intelligence or information available on herointrafficking involving Cambodia. There have been no significant heroin seizuresin the U.S. either transiting through or initiated from Cambodia. Corruption has been identified as an endemic problem in Cambodia, andhas adversely affected drug law enforcement. Poorly paid and ill-trainedpolice and judicial officials have been all-too-easy to look the otherway in narcotics and other criminal cases. Cambodia established a "National Authority for Combating Drugs" anda "Special Drug Enforcement Unit" in the Ministry of the Interior. Theappointed heads of these units currently do not have any law enforcementunits directly under their control, but do have the ability to call onresources from other enforcement agencies. The National Police remain DEA'sprimary contact. This year, the DEA's Office of International Training is scheduled toput on the Basic Investigators Training Seminar. The seminar will includeapproximately 60 National Police Officers. Nigeria:The Nigerian National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLA) has providedsome cooperation to DEA in those areas where it can. The most basic ofdrug law enforcement equipment is unavailable to the NDLEA. The NDLEA continuesto be underfunded, undertrained, and underpaid by the Government of Nigeria(GON), calling into question the GON's own will to attack and prosecutemajor drug traffickers operating in Nigeria. NDLEA officials continued to arrest low level couriers and growers.Major traffickers and organizations were largely unaffected. This is dueto the lack of training and modern equipment needed to identify, locate,monitor, and investigate the activities of the major drug traffickers operatingin Nigeria. Officials of the GON are quick to point to their yearly seizure statistics,which are slightly misleading. For example, in 1998 the NDLEA reports thatthey seized "over 10 tons of narcotics", which, taken at face value, appearsto be an impressive statistic. When urged to provide a breakdown of thedrug types seized, it is discovered that nine of those metric tons werecannabis, 503 kilograms were unspecified psychotropic drugs, 17 kilogramswere cocaine and only three kilograms, seized for the entire year, wereheroin. The bulk of the cannabis seizures are a result of an active plant eradicationprogram. The cannabis products are destined for local consumption and exportationto neighboring African countries, and some to various destinations in Europe.While it is a source of pride for the GON, the cannabis seizures have littleimpact on the United States. The NDLEA attempts to prosecute narcotics and money laundering violators,but are stymied by a dysfunctional judicial system and occasionally bygovernment corruption. Although there have been asset seizures in the past, a weakness in thelaw does not allow for asset forfeiture without a prior conviction of theowner of the asset. Since convictions are rare, no drug related forfeitureshave been reported. Afghanistan:The political situation in Afghanistan has adversely affected DEA'sstrategy and enforcement efforts. Due to security reasons, the Departmentof State has prohibited travel to Afghanistan for all of this year. UntilSpecial Agents can travel to Afghanistan, accurate reporting will be sporadicand unconfirmed. Currently, there are no ongoing counter narcotics programsor any cooperation in investigations underway between the U.S. and Afghanistan.Illegal drug production in Afghanistan, however, remains a major problemwhich must be addressed. Drug traffickers in Afghanistan are both the world's largest producersof illicit opium and major producers of cannabis products. In the absenceof a stable and universally recognized central government and the toleranceof poppy cultivation and conversion laboratories by the Taliban, cultivationof opium poppies is likely to increase in Afghanistan. According to the U.S. Government, 51,500 hectares of opium poppy werecultivated in 1999, versus 41,720 hectares in 1998, a 23% increase. Fromthis an estimated 1,670 metric tons of opium were produced, versus 1,350last year, a 24% increase. The increase results from favorable economicand environmental conditions, in particular high opium prices during theplanting season combined with ideal weather conditions during harvest. During 1999, representatives of the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, to includeDEA, have met several times with the Taliban High Commissioner for NarcoticsControl. In a recent meeting, the Taliban High Commissioner for Narcoticsstated that the Taliban government had taken measures to eliminate narcotics.He claimed that the government had recently seized 2,000 kilograms of opiumand heroin and had destroyed 34 laboratories. Other significant hauls havetaken place at various airports and border areas under Taliban control.A recent Taliban edict strongly admonished farmers to reduce poppy cultivationby one-third in the year 2000. A common complaint by the Taliban governmentis that the international community does not give the Taliban due creditfor these successes. The Taliban High Commissioner for Narcotics also deniedreports that the Taliban tax opium production. Afghanistan remains essentially a country divided into regions controlledby tribal leaders, all of whose support is necessary to effectively rulethe country. Afghanistan is not a center for money laundering and financialinstitutions barely exist. Due to the total destruction of the Afghan economy,narcotic traffickers often use proceeds to purchase goods abroad and smugglethese items into Afghanistan. Afghanistan continues to be a major recipient of multi-ton quantitiesof acetic anhydride, which is an essential chemical in the production ofheroin. Shipments of acetic anhydride arrive regularly for such purportedusage as leather tanning and machine cleaning. As there are no known legitimatebusinesses in Afghanistan utilizing acetic anhydride, these consignmentsare highly suspect. Chemicals used in heroin processing laboratories inAfghanistan usually are imported from India, Germany, and the former SovietUnion. Some progress has been made in the tracking of shipments from westerncountries. Several manufacturers have recently been cooperating and advisingDEA of suspect deliveries destined for Southwest Asia. Haiti:Haiti continues to be a transshipment and storage site for multi-hundredkilogram quantities of cocaine from South and Central America. The country'slong coastline, mountainous interior, numerous uncontrolled airstrips,and its 193-mile border with the Dominican Republic, as well as its locationin the Caribbean, make it an excellent transit site for drug shipmentsfrom Colombia destined for the United States. Colombian traffickers are the major players in the drug transportationbusiness in Haiti. As a result, Colombian organizations have become entrenchedin Haiti, and have cultivated long-standing relationships with Haitianand Dominican traffickers in order to facilitate their activities. Colombian traffickers, operating through Haitian contacts, transportmultihundred-kilogram quantities of cocaine through the southern coastof Haiti. Colombian traffickers are divided into two groups; those whohave lived in Haiti for some time and control drug operations and thosewho routinely travel to Haiti aboard commercial aircraft and vessels. The three primary methods for smuggling drugs into Haiti are noncommercialair methods, noncommercial maritime activities (primarily go-fast operationstransiting from Colombia to Haiti's Southern Claw) and containerized cargoon freighters or commercial/passenger aircraft. As drugs enter Haiti, theyare stored locally until they can be shipped to the United States or Europe.Drugs are smuggled out of Haiti via coastal freighters or containerizedshipping. The primary shipping routes are: Directly to the Miami River/South Florida area from one of several Haitianports such as Port-au-Prince, Miragoane, St. Marc, Gonaives, Cap Haitien,or Port de Paix. The drugs are typically secreted in hidden compartmentswithin coastal freighters. Transferred overland from Haiti to the Dominican Republic and then smuggledacross the Mona Passage into Puerto Rico via small vessels. Once in PuertoRico, the illicit drugs are then hidden in containerized cargo and shippedto the United States or Europe. Transferred overland from Haiti to the Dominican Republic and then smuggledinto the United States or Europe via containerized cargo. Jimani, Pederales,Malpaso, Dajabon, and Pepilo Salcedo are the border points that are mostfrequently crossed.Between May 1998 and January 2000, approximately 3,850 kilograms of cocainehas been seized off of 16 vessels coming into the Miami River from Haiti.In addition, on March 16, 1999, approximately 1.3 million dollars, whichhad been destined for Haiti, was seized on the Miami River off of the M/VLady Crystal. On January 31, 2000, an additional $1 million, which wasdestined for Haiti, was seized.#*#doctype html public "-//w3c//dtd html 4.0 transitional//en"#*#DEA - Publications - Congressional Testimony - 03/21/00Statement by:Donnie R. MarshallActing AdministratorDrug Enforcement AdministrationUnited States Department of Justice Before the:Senate Drug Caucus on International Narcotics Control Date:March 21, 2000 Note: This document may not reflect changes made in actual delivery. Chairman Grassley, Members of the Senate. I appreciate this opportunityto appear before the Committee today to discuss the issue of Certificationand U.S. Counter narcotics efforts. I would like first to thank the Committeefor its continued support of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)and overall support of drug law enforcement. As all of you are aware, DEA is first and foremost a law enforcementagency. Although the certification process has proved to be an effectivediplomatic tool relative to the international antidrug effort, as a matterof policy, DEA does not make recommendations relative to certification.Each year, DEA provides the Attorney General with an objective assessmentof the drug trafficking situation for a country based upon evidence andfactual information. DEA's analysis of counter-narcotics efforts by anothercountry does not include an opinion on whether a country should or shouldnot be certified. We merely present the facts to U.S. policy makers andallow them to make an informed decision on the certification of a respectivecountry. As such, my comments today will be limited to an objective assessmentof the law enforcement issues involved with drug trafficking. As part of the submitted written testimony, I have also included thedrug trafficking assessment reports of several countries which were recentlyevaluated and either decertified or granted a waiver due to vital U.S.interests. These countries include Afghanistan, Burma, Cambodia, Paraguay,Nigeria, and Haiti. Due, however, to the magnitude of the threat drug traffickerspose to the national security of both countries, along with the strategicimportance to the United States, I will direct much of today's testimonyon Mexico. As many of you know, criminal organizations based in Mexico pose thegreatest challenge to U.S. law enforcement agencies charged with enforcingnarcotics laws. Due to the ever-increasing legitimate cross-border trafficand commerce between the U.S. and Mexico, several international organizedcrime groups have established elaborate smuggling infrastructures on bothsides of the U.S./Mexico border. Furthermore, it has long been establishedthat in addition to drug trafficking, these international criminal organizationsspawn violence, corruption, and intimidation that threaten the safety andstability of our cities and towns across America. The complex and sophisticated international drug trafficking groupsoperating out of Mexico are oftentimes vicious, destructive entities, thatoperate on a global scale. The largest drug trafficking organizations inMexico --- operating out of Guadalajara, Juarez, Mexicali, Tijuana, Sonora,and the Gulf region --- under the auspices of Vicente Carrillo-Fuentes,Armando Valencia-Cornelio, Miguel Caro-Quintero, Ramon and Benjamin Arellano-Felix,and Osiel Cardenas-Guillen are in many ways, the modern versions of themob leaders and groups that U.S. law enforcement has fought against sincethe beginning of last century. These international organized crime leaders,however, are far more dangerous, far more influential, and have a greaterimpact on our day-to-day lives than did their domestic predecessors. Those international traffickers and their organizations make operationaldecisions from places like Sonora, Mexico, and other locations outsideU.S. borders, which detrimentally affect the quality of life of our citizensand directly support drug-related crime in cities and towns across ourcountry. These groups have reached new levels of sophistication and havebecome a threat not only to the United States and Europe, but also to theirown countries. Their power and influence are unprecedented. Unless innovative,flexible, multi-faceted responses are crafted, these drug trafficking organizationsthreaten to grow even more powerful in the years to come. The Damage to the United States:In order to understand the extent and nature of the damage caused byinternational drug trafficking organizations, it is crucial to look athow these organizations work, and how they infiltrate and position themselvesin U.S. communities in order to further their goals. On any given day in the United States, business transactions are beingarranged between the major drug lords headquartered in Mexico and theirsurrogates who have established roots within the United States, for theshipment, storage, and distribution of tons of illicit drugs. In the past,Mexico-based criminal organizations limited their activities to the cultivationof marijuana and opium poppies for subsequent production of marijuana andheroin. The organizations were also relied upon by Colombian drug lordsto transport loads of cocaine into the United States, and to pass on thiscocaine to other organizations who distributed the product throughout theU.S. However, over the past several years, Mexico-based organized crimesyndicates have gained increasing control over many of the aspects of thecocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, and marijuana trades, resulting in increasedthreats to the well-being of American citizens as well as government institutionsand the citizens of their own country. In the recent past, traffickers from Mexico had maintained dominancein the western part of the United States, and in some Midwest cities. Today,the Drug Enforcement Administration, along with other law enforcement agencies,has developed evidence leading to indictments demonstrating that associatesof organized crime groups based in Mexico have established themselves onthe East Coast of the United States, thus becoming significant participantsin the nationwide drug trade. Mexican Traffickers Rise to Prominence:During 1995 and 1996, intense law enforcement pressure was focused onthe Cali leadership by the brave men and women of the Colombian NationalPolice. As a result, all of the top trafficking leaders from Cali wereeither jailed or killed. During that time frame, U.S. law enforcement agencieswere effectively attacking Colombian cells operating within the UnitedStates. With the Cali leaders imprisoned in Colombia and the successfulattacks by law enforcement on their U.S. cells, traffickers from Mexicotook on greater prominence. A growing alliance between the Colombian traffickersand the organizations from Mexico worked to benefit both sides. Traffickersfrom Mexico had long been involved in smuggling marijuana, heroin, andcocaine across the U.S.-Mexico border, using established distribution routesto deliver drugs throughout the United States. The Mexico-based organizations'emergence as major methamphetamine producers and traffickers also contributedto making them a major force in international drug trafficking. The Mexicantraffickers, who were previously paid in cash by the Colombian traffickersfor their services, began to routinely receive up to one-half of a shipmentof cocaine as their payment. This led to Mexican traffickers having accessto multi-ton quantities of cocaine and allowed them to expand their marketsand influence in the United States, thereby making them formidable cocainetraffickers in their own right. With the disruption of the Cali syndicate, Mexican groups such as theAmado Carrillo-Fuentes organization, the Arellano-Felix cartel, the Amezcua-Contrerasbrothers, and the Caro-Quintero group, consolidated their power and beganto dominate drug trafficking along the U.S.-Mexican border and in manyU.S. cities. Recent events in Mexico and along the southwest border emphasizethe fact that trafficking groups from Mexico have developed into a significantforce in international organized crime. Overview of Narcotics Smuggled along the U.S.-Mexican Border:Recent estimates indicate that approximately 55% of the cocaine availablein the United States is transported across the U.S.-Mexico border. Typically,large cocaine shipments are transported from Colombia, via commercial shipping,fishing and "go-fast" boats and off-loaded in Mexico. The cocaine is transportedthrough Mexico, usually by trucks, where it is warehoused in cities likeGuadalajara, Tijuana or Juarez, that are operating bases for the majorcriminal trafficking organizations. The extremely high volume of vehiculartraffic over the U.S./Mexico border allows cocaine loads to be driven acrossthe border and taken to major distribution centers within the U.S., suchas Los Angeles, New Jersey, Chicago, or Phoenix. Surrogates of the majordrug lords wait for instructions, often provided over sophisticated communicationsdevices--phones, faxes, pagers or computers--telling them where to warehousesmaller loads, who to contact for transportation services, and to whomto return the eventual profits. Individuals sent to the United States fromMexico, often illegally, have been shown to have contracted with U.S. truckingestablishments to move loads across the country. Once the loads arrivein an area that is close to the eventual terminal point, safehouses areestablished for workers who watch over the cocaine supplies and arrangefor it to be distributed by wholesale dealers within the vicinity. Thesedistributors have traditionally been Colombian nationals or individualsfrom the Dominican Republic, but recently, DEA has come upon evidence thatMexican trafficking organizations are also directly involved in cocainedistribution in New York City. We have not only identified the drug lords themselves, but in most cases,the key members of their command and control structure. The combined effortsof the DEA, FBI, DOJ, the U.S. Customs Service, and members of state andlocal police departments have resulted in the seizure of hundreds of tonsof drugs, hundreds of millions of dollars in drug proceeds, and most importantly,several significant indictments. In fact, some of the leaders of theseorganizations - Ramon and Benjamin Arellano-Felix, Luis and Jesus Amezcua-Contreras,Vicente Carrillo-Fuentes - have become familiar names in every major lawenforcement department in the United States. Despite this evidence, alongwith the notoriety, these traffickers have continued to evade arrest andprosecution. The primary reason they have been able to avoid arrest and continuetheir criminal enterprise is their ability to intimidate witnesses andassassinate and corrupt public officials. Clear examples of this pointmay be cited in recent efforts to apprehend members of the Arellano Felixcartel and the Cardenas Guillen cartel, based in Tijuana and Matamoros,Mexico, respectively. In Tijuana over the past year, Mexican officials,have not been able to apprehend key traffickers working for the ArellanoFelix organization. In November 1999, major Gulf cartel drug traffickerOsiel Cardenas Guillen illegally detained and assaulted two U.S. drug enforcementagents in Matamoros, Mexico, across the international border from Brownsville,Texas. Methamphetamine traffickers, oftentimes associated with major Mexicanorganized crime groups, obtain the precursor chemicals necessary for methamphetamineproduction from sources in other countries, such as China and India, aswell as from rogue chemical suppliers in the United States. In fact, Mexico-basedtransnational criminal organizations have become the most significant distributorsin the U.S. of methamphetamine and its precursor chemicals. Several bulkephedrine seizures destined for Mexico have focused attention on the magnitudeof ephedrine acquisition by Mexican organized crime groups. Methamphetaminesuper labs, capable of producing hundreds of pounds of methamphetamineon a weekly basis, are established in Mexico or in California, where themethamphetamine is provided to traffickers to distribute across the UnitedStates. Heroin from Mexico now represents 14% of the heroin seized in the UnitedStates by federal authorities, and it is estimated that 43 metric tonsof opium gum was produced in 1999 in Mexico. A recent study conducted bythe DEA indicates that as much as 29% of the heroin being used in the U.S.is being smuggled in by the Mexico-based organized crime syndicates. Mexicanblack tar heroin is produced in Mexico, and transported over the borderin cars and trucks. Like cocaine and methamphetamine, it is traffickedby associates of the organized criminal groups in Mexico, and providedto dealers and users in the Southwest, Northwest, and Midwest areas ofthe United States. At one time, it was commonplace for couriers to carrytwo pounds or so of heroin into the United States; recently, quantitiesof heroin seized from individuals have increased as is evidenced by largerseizures in a number of towns in Texas. This heroin is extremely potent,and its use has resulted in a significant number of deaths. Marijuana from Mexico still dominates the illicit U.S. import marketalthough U.S. experts estimate Mexico's marijuana production at 3,700 metrictons (compared with 4,600 in 1998 and 4,800 in 1997). In addition, during1999, the GOM eradicated some 23,547 hectares of marijuana (down from 24,200in 1998). Seizures of Mexican marijuana have increased from 102 metrictons in 1991 to 836.3 metric tons in 1999. Marijuana organizations fromMexico are very powerful and violent. In some places, traffickers fromMexico have established marijuana cultivation operations within the UnitedStates. In a recent case in Idaho, DEA , working with other Federal, state,and local law enforcement officials, arrested a group of illegal aliensfrom Zacatecas, Mexico. A total of 114,000 marijuana plants, weighing almost20 tons, was seized. This operation represented the largest marijuana seizureever in the state of Idaho. It is important to note that although many of the transactions relatingto the drug trade take place on U.S. soil, the major organized crime bossesdirect each and every detail of their multi-billion dollar business whilesituated in Mexico. They are responsible not only for the business decisionsbeing made, but also ultimately for the devastation that many Americancommunities have suffered as a result of the influx of cocaine, methamphetamine,heroin, and marijuana. These powerful and organized syndicates can frustratethe ability of the Mexican anti-drug police. Their ability to place obstaclessuch as corruption and unlimited resources in the path of police can oftentimesimpede investigations. In the past year, none of the major Mexican traffickingorganizations have been dismantled or significantly disrupted by Mexicanauthorities. Law Enforcement Response:Reporting indicates that the Southwest border (SWB) remains a majorpoint of entry for approximately 70% of all illicit drugs smuggled intoour country by Mexican trafficking groups. In response to this continuedthreat along the border, the DEA has established several initiatives thatfacilitate and improve intelligence and information sharing, while identifyingand removing impediments to cooperation. These initiatives employ a multi-prongedstrategy, which utilizes and combines law enforcement operations, intelligenceoperations, and provides for law enforcement assistance in order to achievesuccess in combating criminal drug trafficking organizations along theborder. The objective of these initiatives is to disrupt and ultimatelydismantle criminal organizations that smuggle illicit drugs into the U.S.by linking Federal, state and local investigations domestically and mobilizingmultilateral enforcement efforts abroad. Based upon past trends, intelligence,and recent seizures along the border, the DEA has established the followingpriorities for the SWB Field Divisions: (1) cocaine investigations involvingviolent organizations; (2) methamphetamine investigations, (3) heroin investigations,(4) marijuana investigations, (5) money laundering investigations and (6)diverted/dangerous drug and chemical investigations. Enforcement Operations/Strategies:In response to the emergence of these Mexican Drug Trafficking Organization's(MDTO), it became apparent that a coordinated strategy for law enforcementcounterdrug activities needed to be implemented. In order to combat drugproduction and trafficking networks operating along the U.S./Mexican border,DEA, in concert with other Federal agencies, established the SouthwestBorder Initiative - an integrated, coordinated law enforcement effort designedto attack the command and control structure of organized criminal operationsassociated with the Mexican Federation. This strategy focuses on intelligenceand enforcement efforts which target drug distribution systems within theU.S. and directs resources toward the disruption of those principal drugtrafficking organizations operating across the border. As such, DEA, in cooperation with other Federal, state, and local lawenforcement agencies is focusing increased intelligence, technical resources,and investigative expertise on the major MDTO's responsible for smugglingvast quantities of cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamine acrossthe border. Apart from this effort, DEA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation(FBI) also provide assistance in the form of operational planning, intelligence,and training to Government of Mexico (GOM) law enforcement authorities,to strengthen their capacity to combat these organizations. The SouthwestBorder strategy targets specific Mexican trafficking organizations operatingacross the border and attacks their command and control infrastructureswherever they operate. Further, the Special Operations Division (SOD) is a joint national coordinatingand support entity comprised of agents, analysts, and prosecutors fromDOJ, Customs, FBI, DEA and IRS. Its mission is to coordinate and supportregional and national criminal investigations and prosecutions againsttrafficking organizations that most threaten the U.S. SOD performs seamlesslyacross both investigative agency and district jurisdictional boundaries,providing field offices with necessary support, assistance, intelligenceanalysis and "leads" for investigative action. Within SOD, no distinctionis made among the participating investigative agencies. Where appropriate,state and local authorities are fully integrated into coordinated operations.As presently configured, SOD consists of five sections; each of which hasboth DEA, FBI, and USCS personnel assigned. One section targets ColombianTrafficking Organizations, a second concentrates on cocaine and herointrafficking in Europe and Asia, a third targets money laundering organizations,and the remaining two sections are the heart of the Southwest Border Projectand focus their efforts on the principal MDTO's. These two sections target,among other things, the command and control networks of the identifiedMDTO's, and their supporting organizations operating along the Southwestborder. As such, the interagency regional objectives are as follows; (1)Intelligence collection and analysis, (2) Investigations, (3) Interdictionand Enforcement and (4) Prosecution and Incarceration. The following operationdelineates the need and significance for such a multi-agency project: Operation Impunity:In September 1999, the DEA announced the conclusion of a two-year internationalinvestigation that culminated in the arrest of over 106 individuals linkedto the Amado Carrillo Fuentes (ACF) drug trafficking organization, headquarteredin Cancun, Mexico. This investigation, known as "Operation Impunity," wasa multi-jurisdictional, multi-agency investigation which directly linkeddrug trafficking activity in the United States to the highest level ofthe Mexican cocaine trade. This investigation began in January 1998 and was conducted jointly bythe DEA, FBI, USCS, U.S. Attorneys' Offices, DOJ/Criminal Division, anda host of state and local law enforcement agencies. The investigation encompassed53 DEA, FBI, and USCS case investigations which spans 14 Federal judicialdistricts. Since 1998, this investigation has resulted in 36 seizures,netting 12,434 kilograms of cocaine, a half a kilo of heroin, 4,806 poundsof marijuana, more than $19 million in U.S. currency, and the arrest of106 individuals. The above statistics only tell part of the story. Operation Impunitydemonstrated an unparalleled coordinated and cooperative effort among thelaw enforcement community. Overall, this investigation allowed the lawenforcement community to ascertain this organization's method of operationfrom the narcotic distribution in Colombia to the transportation throughMexico to the ultimate distribution networks throughout the U.S. Such successclearly demonstrates the need for the continuation of long term, multi-agencyinvestigations. Cooperative Efforts with the Government of Mexico/Status of VettedUnits:Subsequent to the arrest of General Gutierrez Rebollo in 1997 and theestablishment of mechanisms within the Mexican law enforcement infrastructure,such as the Bilateral Task Forces (BTFs) and the Vetted Unit program, DEAbecame cautiously optimistic relative to the prospects of the GOM's commitmentto bilateral investigations. The DEA has supported these programs financiallyand with other resources in hope that our efforts would result in a successfulattack against the drug lords who are creating so much havoc throughoutcommunities in the United States. However, continuing reports of corruptionand the rapidly growing power and influence of the major organized criminalgroups in Mexico cause us great concern about the long-term prospects forsuccess. Perhaps the arrest of Operation Impunity target Jaime AguilarGastelum and Operation Millennium target Guillermo Moreno-Rios, by Mexicanauthorities, is indicative of the GOM's future commitment to such jointventures. However, in the last year the Vetted Units Program in Mexico has notachieved the potential as originally envisioned by both governments. Inorder to address this issue, the DEA and the Government of Mexico's equivalentto the DEA, the Fiscalia Especializada Para la Atencion de Delitos Contrala Salud (FEADS), have agreed to carefully review the Program and establishways to improve its efficiency and effectiveness against mutually agreedinvestigative targets. The DEA also provides support and assistance tothe FEADS to conduct investigative endeavors throughout Mexico. These investigationsare being conducted with the primary investigative component of the FEADSvetted units - the Bilateral Task Forces (BTF's). Unfortunately, the investigative achievements by the BTF and the SensitiveInvestigations Unit (SIU) as related to cases against the major drug traffickingorganizations are minimal. The inability of these units to fully employthe new investigative techniques and authorities provided in the OrganizedCrime Law to investigate these major organizations has been equally disappointing.Further complicating investigative efforts, the Mexico City-based SIU wascompromised in February 1999 by a Mexican news exposé describingthe operations of that unit, to include its location, activities, and investigativetargets. Because of this setback, the SIU has been largely shut down. Inaddition, throughout 1999 police personnel from the Mexico City SIU wereseparated into smaller groups and often deployed to various regions throughoutMexico in order to work other investigations, such as the search for Mexicofugitive and former Governor of the State of Quintana Roo Mario Villanueva-Madrid. On a positive note, vetted unit personnel of the Organized Crime Unit(OCU), of which the SIU is a part, have been investigating a drug smugglingnetwork of the Carrillo-Fuentes organization in Cancun, headed by AlcidesRamon-Magana. During the course of this investigation, DEA has shared threeprincipal witnesses with the OCU who have provided information regardingthis organization . The information gleaned from these witnesses has contributedto the seizure of real estate in Quintana Roo and the arrest of severaldefendants in this case, including mid-level drug trafficker and money-laundererCarlos Colin-Padilla. In addition, the GOM issued arrest warrants for atotal of 44 individuals associated with Ramon-Magana including an arrestwarrant issued on April 5, 1999, against former Governor Villanueva Madridon 28 counts of drug related offenses. The governments of Mexico and the United States will continue to workcooperatively on investigations. Just this month, based upon informationprovided by the DEA to the GOM, two such operations were conducted, resultingin the seizure of a cocaine laboratory and a methamphetamine laboratoryin Mexico. Ultimately, DEA believes that the vetting process is our bestchance at ensuring integrity with our counterparts. As mentioned in previoustestimony today with respect to the ongoing bilateral Vetted Units Programsurvey, DEA will remain actively engaged with our GOM counterparts relativeto this process. DEA will also encourage the GOM to fully staff and supportthe BTFs and the SIUs with FEADS personnel that have already been vettedand to supply the resources that these operations require. Corruption Issues:Although the Mexican government is attempting to address the issue ofcorruption, it continues to be a serious problem in Mexican law enforcementinstitutions. The Federal Preventive Police (FPP) was created in early1999 in response to the existing corruption in the police ranks, but recentlyreported that several FPP agents were under investigation for corrupt activities.In December 1999 the Government of Mexico/PGR reported that between April1997 through 1999 more than 1,400 of the 3,500 federal police officershad been fired for corruption and that 357 of the officers had been prosecuted.Additionally, the National Public Safety System established a nationalpolice registry to prevent corrupt police officials from being rehiredby another law enforcement entity. However, the PGR has not fully implementedthese programs to deal with corruption. For example, in 1999, the formerDirector of Investigations for the PGR's SIU and OCU, Cuauhtemoc HerreraSuastegui, was reassigned to a high-level position within the PGR despitefailing polygraph examination in 1998. Although several FEADS vetted "floater"units have had several successes during 1999, the Vetted Unit Program failedto adhere to internal security principles involving the polygraph process,which may lead to potential compromises and corruption. The Mexican militaryalso has experienced narco-related corruption within its ranks. As of July 1999, an amendment to the Judicial Organic law mandated thatPGR officers, prosecutors, police agents, experts, and pilots assignedto narcotics eradication duties are required to undergo an evaluation process,to include background checks and polygraphs. Judicial efforts to stop corruption are also underway. On January 11,2000, a Mexican Federal judge issued an arrest warrant for the magistratewho wrongly freed Adan Amezcua-Contreras, a major methamphetamine trafficker. Perhaps the most alarming incident involving Mexican officials occurredon November 9, 1999, when a DEA Special Agent, along with a FBI SpecialAgent debriefed a Confidential Source in Matamoros, Mexico. During thecourse of this debriefing the Special Agents and Confidential Source weresurrounded and physically threatened by Mexican trafficker Osiel Cardenas-Guillenand approximately 15 associates. Each of these associates, one brandishinga gold-plated automatic assault weapon, were either municipal or statepolice officers. Furthermore, despite monitoring the entire incident overthe DEA Special Agent's cellular telephone, which had been used to callfor assistance, the Tamaulipas State Judicial Police Commander took noaction. Due in large part to their resourcefulness and ability to diffusethis dangerous situation, were the agents and the confidential source ableto survive unscathed. Among other issues, this incident highlights thevulnerability of DEA and FBI Special Agents working in Mexico. Status of Extraditions:The principal leaders of major drug trafficking organizations fear thethreat of extradition to the United States more than any other law enforcementor judicial tool. Extradition of significant traffickers ensures that thoseresponsible for the command and control of illicit activities, includingdrug smuggling and money laundering, will be held totally accountable fortheir actions and serve a prison sentence commensurate with their crimes. No major drug traffickers were extradited to the United States in 1999.The Mexican Government did extradite 10 fugitives on narcotics relatedor money laundering offenses in 1999 -- eight U.S. citizens and two Mexicancitizens. One Mexican citizen, a drug trafficker, was sought on drug chargesafter escaping from a U. S. prison while serving a sentence on drug relatedcrimes. The other Mexican citizen, who killed a United States Border Patrolagent, was sought on murder and marijuana smuggling charges. In September 1998, the Government of Mexico arrested U.S. Citizen andDEA fugitive Randall Jeffrey Spradling in Guadalajara which, given Spradling'sstrong ties to both Mexican and Colombian drug traffickers, was an importantevent. He is fighting extradition to the United States. In the past twelve months, some Mexican Courts have denied extraditionof significant drug traffickers, such as Jaime Ladino-Avila, to the U.S.due to a variety of reasons, such as a very dated legal precedent holdinglife imprisonment unconstitutional in Mexico. At the end of 1999, therewere approximately 40 persons in Mexican custody and subject to extraditionproceedings based on U.S. provisional arrest warrants and extradition requests. Conclusion: The Road Ahead:The United States' long experience with confronting and dismantlingorganized criminal activity has necessitated the development of an aggressive,cohesive, and coordinated strategy to identify, target, arrest, and incapacitatethe leadership of these organizations. DEA's role in addressing the drugproblem is to continue to attack the leadership of these internationalcriminal organizations. With a strategy consisting of mounting attackson the organizational command and control of major Mexican traffickingsyndicates that operate along the U.S./Mexico border, the DEA is able toattack the ability of these organizations to conduct business and impedetheir efforts to import drugs into the U.S. The effectiveness of national and bilateral efforts against drug organizationswill depend largely on demonstrable progress in disrupting and dismantlingthese transnational narco-trafficking organizations. This includes apprehending,prosecuting and convicting major drug traffickers, as well as exercisingextradition laws against those defendants facing federal drug traffickingcharges in the United States, and exposing and prosecuting individualsand businesses involved in providing critical support networks such asfront companies, security, transportation and the like.Therefore, it is imperative for law enforcement to continue to facilitatethe flow of information and intelligence while identifying and removingimpediments to cooperation. In this vein, it is vital for the DEA, alongwith other USG agencies, to continue to support the GOM in the field ofcounternarcotics operations. In turn, DEA encourages and expects the GOMto provide adequate investigative manpower, ongoing integrity testing,financial resources, equipment and reciprocal drug intelligence in supportof bilateral drug law enforcement, which should significantly improve bothgovernments' ability to counter and eliminate transnational drug traffickingorganizations. However, the true sign of success regarding anti-drug efforts in Mexicois best recognized with tangible results from concerted law enforcementefforts, i.e. the arrest and successful prosecution of significant leadersof these major drug cartels in Mexico and; where applicable, their extraditionto the United States to face federal drug trafficking charges. We are notyet there. Part II:As an addendum to the drug trafficking assessment on Mexico, includedare abbreviated drug situation reports on six countries. These countrieswere selected due to the Administration's recent announcement either decertifying(Afghanistan and Burma) or certifying due to vital U.S. interests ( Haiti,Paraguay, Cambodia, and Nigeria). These reports include criteria and guidelinesthat may be evaluated during the certification process. Paraguay:Paraguay's primary role in the cocaine trade is as a transit country.Traffickers send shipments of Bolivian cocaine HCl and base through Paraguayinto Brazil and Argentina for further shipment to the United States andEurope. Recent information also indicates that there is some traffickingof cocaine essential chemicals from Paraguay into Bolivia. Paraguayan cocaine traffickers serve primarily as facilitators for majorBolivian and Brazilian cocaine organizations. Paraguayan transportationgroups have, on occasion, provided aircraft and pilots to transportationgroups operating between Peru, Brazil, and Colombia. A common exchangemethod for Paraguayan traffickers is to trade luxury cars stolen in Asuncionand Argentina for Bolivian cocaine. This makes the capital for large cocainepurchases relatively easy to obtain and allows Bolivian traffickers tolaunder their profits directly into tangible assets. Counter-drug efforts in Paraguay are consolidated under the directionof the Secretariat Nacional Antidrogas (SENAD), a Federal agency with nationalauthority to propose legislation, conduct anti-drug education programs,control the diversion of chemicals and drugs, and to conduct drug investigationsand operations, including eradication efforts. In February 2000 RetiredArmy Colonel Hugo Ibarra was appointed as the director of SENAD. In spiteof continuing political turmoil within the government, Ibarra has displayedsome willingness to conduct investigations into drug trafficking and hascooperated with the DEA in mainly low level investigations. The Anti-Narcotics Directorate of the Paraguayan National Police (DINAR)is a full-time investigative unit consisting of approximately 100 policespecial agent personnel. DINAR is controlled organizationally and financiallyby SENAD. The DEA Asuncion Country Office (ACO) utilizes both organizationsto conduct investigations and operations. The formation of a DEA-sponsoredinvestigation/intelligence unit within the DINAR has enhanced the abilityof the ACO to conduct more sensitive investigations and to properly trainand equip this smaller and more secure unit. A criminal code promulgated in 1997 went into effect in November of1998. The new code provided sentencing guidelines for money launderingoffenses. Asset seizures are also provided for under Paraguayan law, butthe law is very new and has only been minimally used. In 1998, the Governmentof Paraguay signed an extradition treaty with the United States, whichincludes a provision for the extradition of nationals. The government alsodrafted legislation that explicitly authorizes undercover operations andcontrolled deliveries. Due to the political instability in Paraguay theproposed legislation remains pending. Burma:In 1999, Burma was named as the world's number two producer of opiumbehind Afghanistan. The 1999 CNC Opium Yield Survey, conducted jointlywith US and Burmese officials estimated the 1999 potential opium yieldto be 1,090 metric tons. This reflects a 38% decrease from 1998 surveyestimates of 1,750 metric tons. In February 2000, the CNC, Embassy andHost Nation officials conducted the 2000 Opium Yield Survey with the DEAas an accompanied observer. Burma continues to be a major producer of both heroin and methamphetamine.Burma accounts for approximately 80 percent of the total production ofSoutheast Asian opium. In 1999, the Government of Burma (GOB) seized 273kilograms of heroin, down from 490 kilograms in 1998. The decrease in seizuresis partly due to opium crop reduction, directly attributed to severe droughtconditions. Also attributed is the response by the GOB against narcotictraffickers, in response to intelligence information provided by DEA. Theincreased enforcement activity on behalf of the GOB has resulted in thetraffickers' utilization of smaller and highly mobile opium refineries. In 1999, the GOB seized in approximately 28.8 million tablets (approximately2,880 kilograms) of methamphetamine. During 1998, the GOB seized 16 milliontablets (approximately 1,600 kilograms). Additionally, in 1999, the GOBsseized 6.43 metric tons of ephedrine. The GOB continues to pursue additionalephedrine smuggling investigations. Methamphetamine produced in Burma is shipped almost exclusively to Thailand.The largest and most recent reported seizure in Thailand was 4.3 milliontablets (approx. 430 kilograms) on March 14, 2000. There have been sixreported seizures of Burmese produced methamphetamine, ranging from 200to 7,800 tablets among the Hmong and Mien communities residing in California. The United States Government policy towards Burma continues to linkpolitical change toward democracy and human rights issues with the narcoticsproblem. Currently minimal assistance is provided to Burma by the U.S.largely through assistance to law enforcement operations and to intelligencesharing by DEA with host government counterparts. Training, utilizing INLfunds, has been prohibited since 1989. The DEA Rangoon Country Office (RCO) has developed a working relationshipwith their Host Nation Counterparts (Directorate of Defense Services Intelligence/DDSI and State Peace and Development Council/SPDC). Intelligence indicates that corruption is rampant in Burma. This situationhas led to petty graft and corruption. However, the government has takenpositive steps to solve this problem by aggressively prosecuting and punishingviolators determined to be involved in corrupt practices. Cambodia:The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) enjoys a good relationshipwith the Cambodian National Police and the National Police Anti-Drug Unit.The Anti-Drug Unit is unable to carry out any type of sophisticated investigationdue to the lack of financial resources, extreme shortage of trained personneland lack of adequate investigative equipment. Cambodia is not a major producer of narcotics although large amountsof marijuana are cultivated with multi-ton quantities being exported toEurope. Marijuana production and trafficking is not considered to be amajor threat to the United States. In 1997, enforcement efforts resultedin the disruption and dismantling of a group of Americans identified tobe sending multi ton quantities of marijuana from Cambodia to the WestCoast of the U.S. The investigation resulted in the arrest of several ofits members and the seizure of approximately six tons of marijuana in Cambodiain June of that year. U.S. and Cambodian defendants were subsequently indictedin the U.S. Despite the fact that Cambodia has no extradition treaty withthe U.S., the Cambodian government deported the above defendants to theU.S. to stand trial. Through a cooperative effort, the Government of Cambodia(GOC) allowed DEA agents to interview the defendant's prior to their deportationto the U.S. In addition to the above, the GOC allowed two of their officersto travel to the U.S. and testify in a U.S. Federal Court. There is little hard intelligence or information available on herointrafficking involving Cambodia. There have been no significant heroin seizuresin the U.S. either transiting through or initiated from Cambodia. Corruption has been identified as an endemic problem in Cambodia, andhas adversely affected drug law enforcement. Poorly paid and ill-trainedpolice and judicial officials have been all-too-easy to look the otherway in narcotics and other criminal cases. Cambodia established a "National Authority for Combating Drugs" anda "Special Drug Enforcement Unit" in the Ministry of the Interior. Theappointed heads of these units currently do not have any law enforcementunits directly under their control, but do have the ability to call onresources from other enforcement agencies. The National Police remain DEA'sprimary contact. This year, the DEA's Office of International Training is scheduled toput on the Basic Investigators Training Seminar. The seminar will includeapproximately 60 National Police Officers. Nigeria:The Nigerian National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLA) has providedsome cooperation to DEA in those areas where it can. The most basic ofdrug law enforcement equipment is unavailable to the NDLEA. The NDLEA continuesto be underfunded, undertrained, and underpaid by the Government of Nigeria(GON), calling into question the GON's own will to attack and prosecutemajor drug traffickers operating in Nigeria. NDLEA officials continued to arrest low level couriers and growers.Major traffickers and organizations were largely unaffected. This is dueto the lack of training and modern equipment needed to identify, locate,monitor, and investigate the activities of the major drug traffickers operatingin Nigeria. Officials of the GON are quick to point to their yearly seizure statistics,which are slightly misleading. For example, in 1998 the NDLEA reports thatthey seized "over 10 tons of narcotics", which, taken at face value, appearsto be an impressive statistic. When urged to provide a breakdown of thedrug types seized, it is discovered that nine of those metric tons werecannabis, 503 kilograms were unspecified psychotropic drugs, 17 kilogramswere cocaine and only three kilograms, seized for the entire year, wereheroin. The bulk of the cannabis seizures are a result of an active plant eradicationprogram. The cannabis products are destined for local consumption and exportationto neighboring African countries, and some to various destinations in Europe.While it is a source of pride for the GON, the cannabis seizures have littleimpact on the United States. The NDLEA attempts to prosecute narcotics and money laundering violators,but are stymied by a dysfunctional judicial system and occasionally bygovernment corruption. Although there have been asset seizures in the past, a weakness in thelaw does not allow for asset forfeiture without a prior conviction of theowner of the asset. Since convictions are rare, no drug related forfeitureshave been reported. Afghanistan:The political situation in Afghanistan has adversely affected DEA'sstrategy and enforcement efforts. Due to security reasons, the Departmentof State has prohibited travel to Afghanistan for all of this year. UntilSpecial Agents can travel to Afghanistan, accurate reporting will be sporadicand unconfirmed. Currently, there are no ongoing counter narcotics programsor any cooperation in investigations underway between the U.S. and Afghanistan.Illegal drug production in Afghanistan, however, remains a major problemwhich must be addressed. Drug traffickers in Afghanistan are both the world's largest producersof illicit opium and major producers of cannabis products. In the absenceof a stable and universally recognized central government and the toleranceof poppy cultivation and conversion laboratories by the Taliban, cultivationof opium poppies is likely to increase in Afghanistan. According to the U.S. Government, 51,500 hectares of opium poppy werecultivated in 1999, versus 41,720 hectares in 1998, a 23% increase. Fromthis an estimated 1,670 metric tons of opium were produced, versus 1,350last year, a 24% increase. The increase results from favorable economicand environmental conditions, in particular high opium prices during theplanting season combined with ideal weather conditions during harvest. During 1999, representatives of the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, to includeDEA, have met several times with the Taliban High Commissioner for NarcoticsControl. In a recent meeting, the Taliban High Commissioner for Narcoticsstated that the Taliban government had taken measures to eliminate narcotics.He claimed that the government had recently seized 2,000 kilograms of opiumand heroin and had destroyed 34 laboratories. Other significant hauls havetaken place at various airports and border areas under Taliban control.A recent Taliban edict strongly admonished farmers to reduce poppy cultivationby one-third in the year 2000. A common complaint by the Taliban governmentis that the international community does not give the Taliban due creditfor these successes. The Taliban High Commissioner for Narcotics also deniedreports that the Taliban tax opium production. Afghanistan remains essentially a country divided into regions controlledby tribal leaders, all of whose support is necessary to effectively rulethe country. Afghanistan is not a center for money laundering and financialinstitutions barely exist. Due to the total destruction of the Afghan economy,narcotic traffickers often use proceeds to purchase goods abroad and smugglethese items into Afghanistan. Afghanistan continues to be a major recipient of multi-ton quantitiesof acetic anhydride, which is an essential chemical in the production ofheroin. Shipments of acetic anhydride arrive regularly for such purportedusage as leather tanning and machine cleaning. As there are no known legitimatebusinesses in Afghanistan utilizing acetic anhydride, these consignmentsare highly suspect. Chemicals used in heroin processing laboratories inAfghanistan usually are imported from India, Germany, and the former SovietUnion. Some progress has been made in the tracking of shipments from westerncountries. Several manufacturers have recently been cooperating and advisingDEA of suspect deliveries destined for Southwest Asia. Haiti:Haiti continues to be a transshipment and storage site for multi-hundredkilogram quantities of cocaine from South and Central America. The country'slong coastline, mountainous interior, numerous uncontrolled airstrips,and its 193-mile border with the Dominican Republic, as well as its locationin the Caribbean, make it an excellent transit site for drug shipmentsfrom Colombia destined for the United States. Colombian traffickers are the major players in the drug transportationbusiness in Haiti. As a result, Colombian organizations have become entrenchedin Haiti, and have cultivated long-standing relationships with Haitianand Dominican traffickers in order to facilitate their activities. Colombian traffickers, operating through Haitian contacts, transportmultihundred-kilogram quantities of cocaine through the southern coastof Haiti. Colombian traffickers are divided into two groups; those whohave lived in Haiti for some time and control drug operations and thosewho routinely travel to Haiti aboard commercial aircraft and vessels. The three primary methods for smuggling drugs into Haiti are noncommercialair methods, noncommercial maritime activities (primarily go-fast operationstransiting from Colombia to Haiti's Southern Claw) and containerized cargoon freighters or commercial/passenger aircraft. As drugs enter Haiti, theyare stored locally until they can be shipped to the United States or Europe.Drugs are smuggled out of Haiti via coastal freighters or containerizedshipping. The primary shipping routes are: Directly to the Miami River/South Florida area from one of several Haitianports such as Port-au-Prince, Miragoane, St. Marc, Gonaives, Cap Haitien,or Port de Paix. The drugs are typically secreted in hidden compartmentswithin coastal freighters. Transferred overland from Haiti to the Dominican Republic and then smuggledacross the Mona Passage into Puerto Rico via small vessels. Once in PuertoRico, the illicit drugs are then hidden in containerized cargo and shippedto the United States or Europe. Transferred overland from Haiti to the Dominican Republic and then smuggledinto the United States or Europe via containerized cargo. Jimani, Pederales,Malpaso, Dajabon, and Pepilo Salcedo are the border points that are mostfrequently crossed.Between May 1998 and January 2000, approximately 3,850 kilograms of cocainehas been seized off of 16 vessels coming into the Miami River from Haiti.In addition, on March 16, 1999, approximately 1.3 million dollars, whichhad been destined for Haiti, was seized on the Miami River off of the M/VLady Crystal. On January 31, 2000, an additional $1 million, which wasdestined for Haiti, was seized.#*#

EXN.ca | Technology New Colombian Drug Smugglers Hold Tech AdvantageBy Newsbytes, November 15, 1999BOGOTA, COLOMBIA, 1999 NOV 15 (NB) -- By Douglas Farah, The WashingtonPost. A new generation of Colombian drug traffickers, light-years aheadof the traditional Medellin and Cali cartels in using the Internet andother modern technology, has sharply increased cocaine production andsmuggling in the past two years despite growing budgets for lawenforcement, according to senior US and Colombian intelligenceofficials.These officials in the United States and Colombia said the nimble neworganizations and their high-tech gear are reversing the gains ofearlier years that crippled the older, better known cartels. Despitehaving more resources than ever before, the officials acknowledged thatthey are finding out little about the new organizations that now controlthe multibillion dollar business of producing cocaine and heroin inColombia and moving it, mostly through Mexico, to consumers in theUnited States."It is a whole new generation of traffickers who have carefully studiedand learned from the mistakes of the groups that went before them," saidGen. Rosso Jose Serrano, director of the Colombian National Police whooversaw the dismantling of several major drug cartels. "They maintain anextremely low profile, they mix their licit and illicit businesses, theydon't carry out terrorist acts and they operate in small, autonomouscells. They are much harder to fight than previous groups because theyare much harder to find."Unlike the previous organizations, the new Colombian traffickerscontract out most of their jobs to specialists, who work on a job-to-jobbasis rather than as part of an integrated structure that would beeasier to detect, the sources said. Most Colombian cocaine is sold inbulk to Mexican drug trafficking organizations, which also haveundergone major changes in the last several years. They assume the riskof transporting it to the United States and distributing it."When you take out the leadership of an organization now, you find thatunderneath there is really not an integrated structure," one US officialsaid. "It is smart guys going through their Rolodexes and calling uppeople for specific jobs. . . . They are smarter, less visible and causeus all kinds of trouble."While increasing in sophistication, the traffickers have greatlyexpanded the cultivation and improved the quality of coca  the rawmaterial for cocaine  in Colombian territory controlled by Marxist-ledguerrillas or right-wing paramilitary groups. A senior US JusticeDepartment official said the estimate that Colombia produced 165 metrictons of cocaine in 1998 "will at least double and maybe triple" in 1999.At the same time, the official said, cocaine production in Peru andBolivia has declined because coca cultivation has dropped significantlyin both countries. Until two years ago, Colombian drug cartels reliedheavily on coca grown in Bolivia and Peru to produce cocaine, but theynow grow more high-grade coca than either of the other two Andeannations.This means, according to US and Colombian officials, that overallestimates of cocaine production in South America may not increase asdramatically as the estimates for Colombia alone, but that, after yearsof decline, overall drug production is rising significantly and morecocaine than previously estimated is moving into the United States.Colombian drug traffickers now control most cocaine production from theraw material to the finished product, giving them more control of thedrug-making process and enhancing their profits when the finishedcocaine is sold to Mexican delivery specialists.The boom in Colombian cocaine production comes as the United States hasratcheted up aid to the beleaguered government of President AndresPastrana. In 1999, the United States provided Colombia with $289 millionin aid, mostly to the police and military to fight drug trafficking. TheClinton administration is preparing to request a supplemental bill earlynext year of at least an additional $1 billion over the next threeyears.Unlike the previous waves of drug traffickers, who were allied mostlywith far-right paramilitary squads, the current leadership is prosperingby dealing with all sides in the Colombian conflict.Most coca is grown in the southern and western regions, where thegovernment has no real presence and where the Revolutionary Armed Forcesof Colombia (FARC) makes millions of dollars by protecting the cocafields, taxing cocaine production and guarding laboratories andairstrips. Paramilitary groups allied with the army also profit from thecocaine trade by protecting trafficking routes and running laboratoriesin areas they control.The clearest window into the changes and growth in Colombian and Mexicandrug trafficking structures was provided by Operation Millennium, ajoint US-Colombian operation that netted 31 drug traffickers last month,including several identified by the Drug Enforcement Administration andColombian police as kingpins who moved more cocaine than Pablo Escobarof Medellin or the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers in Cali.Among the most important, according to the DEA, were Alejandro Bernal,Fabio Ochoa and Orlando Sanchez-Cristancho. Sanchez-Cristancho, wantedfor murder in Colombia, is in custody in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. The manidentified as the group's main Mexican operative, Armando Valencia, haseluded arrest.US and Colombian officials found the traffickers were making use of thelatest technology to protect and advance their business. Bernal'soperation kept in touch by using Internet chat rooms protected byfirewalls that made them impossible to penetrate, officials said. Inaddition, each part of the operation fed its information on the day'ssales and drug movements to a computer on a ship off the coast ofMexico, the officials said, so that if one computer were taken down, itwould be impossible to trace the rest of the network.The traffickers also had access to highly sophisticated encryptiontechnology, far beyond what law enforcement has the capacity to breakquickly, sources said. One US official said it took some of their bestcomputers 24 hours to crack a 30-second transmission by the traffickers,making the exercise pointless. They also used sophisticated cellularphone cloning technology, stealing numbers that were already assigned tolegitimate users, using them for a short period of time, then moving onto new numbers.These new techniques helped the traffickers move hundreds of tons ofcocaine over several years before being detected. DEA officials andColombian authorities said Bernal's group, working with Mexicanorganizations led by Valencia, shipped 20 tons to 30 metric tons ofcocaine every month to the United States.Only days before the arrests last month, Barry R. McCaffrey, the Clintonadministration's drug policy director, estimated that a total of 350metric tons of cocaine from the entire Andean region was entering theUnited States every year. "This group was shipping what previousintelligence estimates had shown to be everything entering the UnitedStates," a US official said. "Numbers are all estimates, but clearly wehave a lot more coming in than we thought."The irony, law enforcement officials said, is that many of the changesin drug trafficking strategy are driven by past successes in bringingdown less sophisticated and more visible drug trafficking organizations."We estimate there are several hundred small cartels now operating in anatomized fashion," said a Colombian intelligence official. "Several ofthose groups fed into the organization we dismantled. But there areseveral other people out there as big as Bernal, who can put loadstogether from small organizations, and we don't even have themidentified."US officials agreed there is little intelligence on the new groups.Until Operation Millennium, US officials said they had not even heard ofArmando Valencia, one of the biggest drug transportation operators inMexico.According to Colombian and Mexican officials, Bernal had a Miami-basedbusiness selling bathroom tiles when, in the mid-1980s, he was taken toMexico to do a decorating job for Amado Carrillo Fuentes, the leader ofthe Juarez cartel. Bernal and Carrillo Fuentes became close friends,according to Mexican, Colombian and US officials, growing so close thatCarrillo Fuentes was named the godfather of Bernal's twin daughters.Bernal was arrested in Mexico in 1989 with nearly 1,280 pounds ofcocaine. When he was released three years later, he decided to return toColombia, the sources said.At the time, Escobar's Medellin cartel waged an open war against thestate through a terrorist campaign and high-profile assassinations.Escobar and most of his top henchmen were killed in 1993. The Calicartel then emerged as the premier trafficking structure, buyingpolitical influence and judicial protection. The cartel's dominanceended in 1995, when its leaders were arrested or killed in a series ofpolice raids.With few strong leaders left in Colombia, intelligence sources said,Bernal slowly began assembling specialists from remnants of differentorganizations and working with his Mexican connections to assemble aformidable cocaine pipeline.Carrillo Fuentes died while undergoing cosmetic surgery in July 1997,and shortly after that Colombia revived its extradition agreement withthe United States. Fearing indictment and possible extradition if hemoved his drugs directly to the United States, Bernal cut a deal inearly 1998 with a Carrillo Fuentes lieutenant named Armando Valencia,Colombian and Mexican officials said.The alliance prospered, according to US, Colombian and Mexicanofficials, because Bernal and Valencia were able to broker deals withdrug trafficking organizations often at war with each other: Bernal withthe FARC and paramilitaries, and Valencia with the Juarez cartel and itsmain rival, the Tijuana-based Arellano-Felix organization. Both leaderswere able to remain undetected by law enforcement officials for years.One factor in the rapid growth of the Bernal-Valencia organization,according to US, Mexican and Colombian officials, is that Bernal wouldpay for cocaine delivered to him in Colombia even before he sold it toValencia, thereby removing the risk for small Colombian traffickers.

A new generation of Colombian drug traffickers, light-years aheadof the traditional Medellin and Cali cartels in using the Internet andother modern technology, has sharply increased cocaine production andsmuggling in the past two years despite growing budgets for lawenforcement, according to senior US and Colombian intelligenceofficials.These officials in the United States and Colombia said the nimble neworganizations and their high-tech gear are reversing the gains ofearlier years that crippled the older, better known cartels. Despitehaving more resources than ever before, the officials acknowledged thatthey are finding out little about the new organizations that now controlthe multibillion dollar business of producing cocaine and heroin inColombia and moving it, mostly through Mexico, to consumers in theUnited States."It is a whole new generation of traffickers who have carefully studiedand learned from the mistakes of the groups that went before them," saidGen. Rosso Jose Serrano, director of the Colombian National Police whooversaw the dismantling of several major drug cartels. "They maintain anextremely low profile, they mix their licit and illicit businesses, theydon't carry out terrorist acts and they operate in small, autonomouscells. They are much harder to fight than previous groups because theyare much harder to find."Unlike the previous organizations, the new Colombian traffickerscontract out most of their jobs to specialists, who work on a job-to-jobbasis rather than as part of an integrated structure that would beeasier to detect, the sources said. Most Colombian cocaine is sold inbulk to Mexican drug trafficking organizations, which also haveundergone major changes in the last several years. They assume the riskof transporting it to the United States and distributing it."When you take out the leadership of an organization now, you find thatunderneath there is really not an integrated structure," one US officialsaid. "It is smart guys going through their Rolodexes and calling uppeople for specific jobs. . . . They are smarter, less visible and causeus all kinds of trouble."While increasing in sophistication, the traffickers have greatlyexpanded the cultivation and improved the quality of coca  the rawmaterial for cocaine  in Colombian territory controlled by Marxist-ledguerrillas or right-wing paramilitary groups. A senior US JusticeDepartment official said the estimate that Colombia produced 165 metrictons of cocaine in 1998 "will at least double and maybe triple" in 1999.At the same time, the official said, cocaine production in Peru andBolivia has declined because coca cultivation has dropped significantlyin both countries. Until two years ago, Colombian drug cartels reliedheavily on coca grown in Bolivia and Peru to produce cocaine, but theynow grow more high-grade coca than either of the other two Andeannations.This means, according to US and Colombian officials, that overallestimates of cocaine production in South America may not increase asdramatically as the estimates for Colombia alone, but that, after yearsof decline, overall drug production is rising significantly and morecocaine than previously estimated is moving into the United States.Colombian drug traffickers now control most cocaine production from theraw material to the finished product, giving them more control of thedrug-making process and enhancing their profits when the finishedcocaine is sold to Mexican delivery specialists.The boom in Colombian cocaine production comes as the United States hasratcheted up aid to the beleaguered government of President AndresPastrana. In 1999, the United States provided Colombia with $289 millionin aid, mostly to the police and military to fight drug trafficking. TheClinton administration is preparing to request a supplemental bill earlynext year of at least an additional $1 billion over the next threeyears.Unlike the previous waves of drug traffickers, who were allied mostlywith far-right paramilitary squads, the current leadership is prosperingby dealing with all sides in the Colombian conflict.Most coca is grown in the southern and western regions, where thegovernment has no real presence and where the Revolutionary Armed Forcesof Colombia (FARC) makes millions of dollars by protecting the cocafields, taxing cocaine production and guarding laboratories andairstrips. Paramilitary groups allied with the army also profit from thecocaine trade by protecting trafficking routes and running laboratoriesin areas they control.The clearest window into the changes and growth in Colombian and Mexicandrug trafficking structures was provided by Operation Millennium, ajoint US-Colombian operation that netted 31 drug traffickers last month,including several identified by the Drug Enforcement Administration andColombian police as kingpins who moved more cocaine than Pablo Escobarof Medellin or the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers in Cali.Among the most important, according to the DEA, were Alejandro Bernal,Fabio Ochoa and Orlando Sanchez-Cristancho. Sanchez-Cristancho, wantedfor murder in Colombia, is in custody in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. The manidentified as the group's main Mexican operative, Armando Valencia, haseluded arrest.US and Colombian officials found the traffickers were making use of thelatest technology to protect and advance their business. Bernal'soperation kept in touch by using Internet chat rooms protected byfirewalls that made them impossible to penetrate, officials said. Inaddition, each part of the operation fed its information on the day'ssales and drug movements to a computer on a ship off the coast ofMexico, the officials said, so that if one computer were taken down, itwould be impossible to trace the rest of the network.The traffickers also had access to highly sophisticated encryptiontechnology, far beyond what law enforcement has the capacity to breakquickly, sources said. One US official said it took some of their bestcomputers 24 hours to crack a 30-second transmission by the traffickers,making the exercise pointless. They also used sophisticated cellularphone cloning technology, stealing numbers that were already assigned tolegitimate users, using them for a short period of time, then moving onto new numbers.These new techniques helped the traffickers move hundreds of tons ofcocaine over several years before being detected. DEA officials andColombian authorities said Bernal's group, working with Mexicanorganizations led by Valencia, shipped 20 tons to 30 metric tons ofcocaine every month to the United States.Only days before the arrests last month, Barry R. McCaffrey, the Clintonadministration's drug policy director, estimated that a total of 350metric tons of cocaine from the entire Andean region was entering theUnited States every year. "This group was shipping what previousintelligence estimates had shown to be everything entering the UnitedStates," a US official said. "Numbers are all estimates, but clearly wehave a lot more coming in than we thought."The irony, law enforcement officials said, is that many of the changesin drug trafficking strategy are driven by past successes in bringingdown less sophisticated and more visible drug trafficking organizations."We estimate there are several hundred small cartels now operating in anatomized fashion," said a Colombian intelligence official. "Several ofthose groups fed into the organization we dismantled. But there areseveral other people out there as big as Bernal, who can put loadstogether from small organizations, and we don't even have themidentified."US officials agreed there is little intelligence on the new groups.Until Operation Millennium, US officials said they had not even heard ofArmando Valencia, one of the biggest drug transportation operators inMexico.According to Colombian and Mexican officials, Bernal had a Miami-basedbusiness selling bathroom tiles when, in the mid-1980s, he was taken toMexico to do a decorating job for Amado Carrillo Fuentes, the leader ofthe Juarez cartel. Bernal and Carrillo Fuentes became close friends,according to Mexican, Colombian and US officials, growing so close thatCarrillo Fuentes was named the godfather of Bernal's twin daughters.Bernal was arrested in Mexico in 1989 with nearly 1,280 pounds ofcocaine. When he was released three years later, he decided to return toColombia, the sources said.At the time, Escobar's Medellin cartel waged an open war against thestate through a terrorist campaign and high-profile assassinations.Escobar and most of his top henchmen were killed in 1993. The Calicartel then emerged as the premier trafficking structure, buyingpolitical influence and judicial protection. The cartel's dominanceended in 1995, when its leaders were arrested or killed in a series ofpolice raids.With few strong leaders left in Colombia, intelligence sources said,Bernal slowly began assembling specialists from remnants of differentorganizations and working with his Mexican connections to assemble aformidable cocaine pipeline.Carrillo Fuentes died while undergoing cosmetic surgery in July 1997,and shortly after that Colombia revived its extradition agreement withthe United States. Fearing indictment and possible extradition if hemoved his drugs directly to the United States, Bernal cut a deal inearly 1998 with a Carrillo Fuentes lieutenant named Armando Valencia,Colombian and Mexican officials said.The alliance prospered, according to US, Colombian and Mexicanofficials, because Bernal and Valencia were able to broker deals withdrug trafficking organizations often at war with each other: Bernal withthe FARC and paramilitaries, and Valencia with the Juarez cartel and itsmain rival, the Tijuana-based Arellano-Felix organization. Both leaderswere able to remain undetected by law enforcement officials for years.One factor in the rapid growth of the Bernal-Valencia organization,according to US, Mexican and Colombian officials, is that Bernal wouldpay for cocaine delivered to him in Colombia even before he sold it toValencia, thereby removing the risk for small Colombian traffickers. Inaddition, Valencia had a reputation for getting his loads safely to theUnited States and guaranteeing that he would cover the losses of anyload that was lost or confiscated.Law enforcement's big break came in December 1998, when the DEA, with awarrant, searched the south Florida home of Carlos Jaramillo, one of theorganization's top US operatives, according to Colombian and USofficials.
