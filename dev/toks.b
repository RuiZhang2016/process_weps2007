Bouldering and Rock Climbing at Webcrag   2/15/04 - Skiers RallyAgainst Recent Yellowstone DecisionMore than 100 Protest Court Ruling Overturning Parks’ SnowmobileBanWest Yellowstone, Montana – More than 100 skiers from aroundthe nation gathered in Yellowstone National Park to speak out againstTuesday’s federal court ruling that again allows snowmobileuse in the park.“We must preserve this park now, before it’stoo late,” said Haidee Wilson from North Carolina. “Thispark is a national, possibly even an international gem, and we mustdo what we can to ensure that future generations can visit Yellowstonein its original state.”The rally, hosted by Winter Wildlands Alliance (WWA)took place just inside the park’s West Gate, which is nowthe entryway for up to 440 snowmobiles per day. On Tuesday, U.S.District Judge Clarence Brimmer issued a temporary restraining orderthat suppresses a pending ban on snowmobiling in Yellowstone andGrand Teton national parks. Brimmer ruled that without the order,companies that rely on snowmobiling in the parks would suffer irreparableharm because of lost business.“I’m upset that [Brimmer’s] decisioncompletely ignores us skiers and snowshoers,” said Mack Brayfrom Jackson Hole, Wyoming. “We stay in hotels, eat in restaurants,and have money that is as green as anyone else’s. But we can’trecreate here in the midst of pollution and engine noise. Withouta ban, there’s just no point in us coming here.”A Dec. 16 ruling by U.S. District Court Judge EmmetSullivan reinstated a Clinton-era plan to phase out snowmobile usein Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks. The effect of thecourt’s ruling would have been to reduce snowmobile use inthe parks this year by half and eliminate snowmobile use next year.Many residents of the Park’s gateway communityof West Yellowstone expressed concerns that the Dec. 16 ruling wouldreduce winter tourism dollars. WWA’s event was to be an attemptat re-introducing human-powered winter recreationists to the park.Many skiers and snowshoers avoided Yellowstone in the winter becauseit was previously considered to be a haven of motorized recreation.Winter Wildlands expects the long-term effect ofa snowmobile ban in the parks to actually be an increase in tourismdollars as more user-groups flock to a safer, quieter, more pristineYellowstone, while snowmobilers continue to utilize the more than1,000 miles of snowmobile trails just outside the Park. WWA officialsestimated that the 105 attendees of their celebration pumped morethan $40,000 into local economies.“Skiers and snowshoers have told us they’reready to return to places like West Yellowstone and we’reconfident they’ll play a key role in expanding the community’stourism base, once snowmobile use is banned from our parks,”said WWA Executive Director Sally Grimes.With a complete phase-out of snowmobiles still scheduledfor next winter, Grimes said it is critical that the Park Service,Congress, local businesses and government leaders, and recreationorganizations like WWA work together to find new ways to draw morewinter visitors to West Yellowstone and other gateway communities.Winter Wildlands is calling for a modernization of the Yellowstonesnowcoach fleet and better education of the public on the diversewinter recreation opportunities in and around Yellowstone. Based in Boise, Idaho, Winter Wildlands representsmore than 19 million skiers, snowshoers, snowboarders, and othernon-motorized snowsports enthusiasts. It is the lone recreationgroup among the six plaintiffs in the federal lawsuit over the NationalPark Service’s winter use plan for Yellowstone and Grand Tetonnational parks.About Winter Wildlands AllianceFounded in 2000, Winter Wildlands Alliance promotes and preserveswinter wildlands and a quality human-powered snowsports experienceon public lands.

The fight for a clean, healthy, and quiet Yellowstoneis far from over and we are more energized than ever.As it did last Presidents Day weekend, Winter WildlandsAlliance is inviting members and supporters from across the UnitedStates to gather in Yellowstone on Valentines Day to voice theirsupport for the park. An estimated 300 supporters are expected toattend both a Friday night pre-rally reception and the main eventon Saturday morning just inside Yellowstones west entrance.The rally comes just four days after U.S. DistrictCourt Judge Clarence Brimmer in Wyoming blocked the phase-out ofsnowmobile use underway in Yellowstone by ruling in favor of thesnowmobile industry and the state of Wyoming. The snowmobile industryand the state are battling to keep snowmobiles in Yellowstone despiteNational Park Service studies that show the way to best protectthe park is to ban the machines. Winter Wildlands joined five nationaland regional conservation and environmental groups in fighting torestore the three-year-old snowmobile phase-out launched by theClinton administration but overturned by the Bush White House. U.S.District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan in Washington agreed with thecoalition in December, overturning the Bush administration planto allow more snowmobiles in Yellowstone and ordering the Park Serviceto begin the phase-out. That ruling was later upheld by an appellatepanel. But this week the Wyoming judge halted the phase-out, promptingthe Park Service to immediately begin allowing vastly more machinesinto the park than allowed so far this winter.The Park Services answer to this controversy isno answer at all, Grimes said. It is now allowing 780 machines intoYellowstone, up from the 493 that were allowed before this ruling.Those who have visited the park so far this winter have been amazedat how much quieter and cleaner it is this year. Now, we are backto business as usual. Yellowstone will be louder, dirtier, and lesshealthy this weekend than it was last weekend.This is Americas park, and Americans have spokenoverwhelmingly in favor of the snowmobile ban that the Park Servicesays is needed to protect Yellowstone. Instead of looking for waysto get more snowmobiles into Yellowstone, we should be focusingon finding the resources needed to get more visitors into the parkon snowcoaches, just as the Park Service suggested three years andmillions of dollars worth of studies ago.During the course of this weekend, Winter Wildlandswill be encouraging Yellowstone rally participants to redouble effortsto contact their elected officials in Washington and to step uplobbying on behalf of a snowmobile-free Yellowstone.Winter Wildlands has joined such groups as The WildernessSociety, National Parks Conservation Association, Greater YellowstoneCoalition, Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club, andthe Natural Trails and Waters Coalition in campaigning to removesnowmobiles from the two parks, as recommended by the Park Servicein 2000, before the Park Service reversed itself after being suedby the snowmobile industry.With thousands of miles of groomed snowmobile trailssurrounding Yellowstone, there are ample opportunities for snowmobilersto enjoy their sport without harming the park and ruining the visitorexperience. Founded in 2000 by grassroots groups throughoutthe country, Winter Wildlands Alliance is the only national organizationworking to protect a quality human-powered winter recreation experience.For more information, contact Sally Grimes, Executive Director,at 208.336.4203 or visit www.winterwildlands.org Note to Reporters: Winter Wildlands Alliance willbe posting photos for your use from Saturdays rally on our website(www.winterwildlands.org)by mid-afternoon Saturday.

He paused. "Man, they're allso awful," he said. "It'd be easier to give you a list that startedat bad and went down to very, very bad." . When movies meet mountains, bad cinema results.Consider "Vertical Limit" (2000), which finds mountaineering sodull that it adds nitroglycerin to the mix. Or "Cliffhanger" (1993),the Sylvester Stallone vehicle propelled by evildoers and stolenloot. The 1997 television adaptation of Jon Krakauer's Everest book,"Into Thin Air," proved so unwatchable that the rescued climbersprobably outnumbered the audience by the end. .

Hilotin, Staff ReporterAlain Roberts, the French Spiderman, will scale one of the six high-risesin Dubai Marina later this month as part of the Dubai Shopping Festivalspectacle. Roberts will attempt free-climbing the Murjan Tower (200metres, including spires) on January 29. Last year, Roberts caused a stir in Abu Dhabi whenhe climbed the National Bank of Abu Dhabi headquarters, drawingan estimated 100,000 spectators. The newly-minted Murjan Tower at Dubai Marina willbe an addition to Roberts' portfolio of over 60 skyscrapers andlandmarks worldwide, including Malaysia's Petronas Towers, the EiffelTower, the Empire State Building, and the straight-faced, glass-frontedSears Tower in Chicago. Roberts spent six days in a Tokyo jail after policeapprehended him for climbing the 225-metre Shinjuku Tower withouta rope, which horrified the Japanese police and fire brigade. He was originally sentenced to between two and sixmonths in jail but a TV channel caught a cop on TV punching Robertsin the face. "It was not that bad, the punch," recalled the Spiderman.But Emaar Properties, developers of Dubai Marina,have welcomed Roberts to climb one of its signature properties alongSheikh Zayed Road. Mansour Al Othaimin, corporate director of EmaarProperties, said: "Roberts brings a message of courage to Dubaiand is a great inspiration for us all. Emaar instantly recognisedhis dedication to achieve excellence, something that we can constantlystrive for in providing quality homes to the community." The Dubai Marina, situated next to the Dubai MediaCity and the Internet City, is a self-contained community carvedout of the desert edge with a 3.5 kilometre free-flowing canal thatwas later flooded with sea water. It is strategically located by Interchange 5, rightnext to the beach-front signature buildings such as the majesticBurj Al Arab and postcard perfect Jumeirah Beach Hotel. Emaar is one of the key sponsors of DSF 2004, whichstarts in seven days. Saeed Al Nabouda, CEO of the Dubai Shopping Festival,said: "There is no doubt that Emaar's participation in DSF willadd more value. They will be presenting many activities that canbe enjoyed by all members of every family of different nationalities."Roberts said climbing is his passion. He suffersfrom vertigo, and his accidents have partly disabled him. But hehas become the world's top solo climber. As a skilled motivational speaker, Roberts bringsa message of hope and inspiration to Dubai. "We set our limits,but we are all strong enough to aim higher, to achieve our goals.All we have to do is find such strength within ourselves and knowhow to develop it." http://www.gulf-news.com/Articles/news.asp?ArticleID=1074301/9/04 - REI and Black Diamond Present the 2004HERA Foundation Climb for Life Road TourNovice and expert climbers alike are invited to participate in theHERA (Health, Empowerment, Research, Advocacy) Foundation's 2004Climb for Life Road Tour, a fundraiser for ovarian cancer research.Participating REI stores and climbing gyms willhost a month-long climbing challenge: to climb as many indoor routesas possible within the designated time period.  Participants canhave friends and family sponsor them and the money raised will gotowards ovarian cancer research and treatment.

BOISE, ID - A federal court ruling against the Bush administration'ssnowmobile plan for Yellowstone National Park will create short-termhardship for some businesses outside Yellowstone, but will be aboon to others and presents a rare opportunity for towns such asWest Yellowstone to diversify their economies, the nation's firstand only organization representing non-motorized winter recreationistssaid. "We understand there will be some local economicdisruption as a result of this ruling, but we also know skiers andother winter recreation enthusiasts will flock to Yellowstone andits gateway communities once snowmobiles are no longer in the park,"said Winter Wildlands Alliance Executive Director Sally Grimes."Skiers have been telling us they're ready to return to placeslike West Yellowstone, and we're confident they'll play a key roleas the community expands its tourism base." Winter Wildlands, based in Boise, represents morethan 17 million skiers, snowshoers, snowboarders, and other non-motorizedsnowsports enthusiasts. It is the lone recreation group among thesix plaintiffs in the federal lawsuit over the National Park Service'swinter use plan for Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks.U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan on Wednesday set asidethe Park Service's plan to allow nearly 1,000 snowmobiles a dayinto Yellowstone and Grand Teton, reinstating a Clinton-era planto phase out snowmobile use in both parks. The effect of the court'sruling is to reduce snowmobile use in the parks this year by half,eliminating it next year. "The important thing for Yellowstone and forthose who want to enjoy its natural beauty in the winter is to moveahead as soon as possible toward replacing snowmobiles with moresnowcoaches to allow all Americans to visit Yellowstone in the winter,"Grimes said. "Yellowstone is not closed this winter, nor willit be closed next winter. All Americans will still enjoy accessto this special place. Now that the court has ruled, it's up toall of us to work with the Park Service and the communities surroundingthese magnificent parks to expand winter recreation opportunitiesin and around the parks." Grimes said it's critical that the Park Service,Congress, local businesses and government leaders, and snowmobileorganizations work together to find new ways to draw more wintervisitors to West Yellowstone and other gateway communities. Thatincludes askig Congress for more funds to expand the Yellowstonesnowcoach fleet and to better educate the public on diverse winterrecreation opportunities in and around Yellowstone. For instance,the Park Service was prepared to spend more than $1 million in taxdollars this winter to assess snowmobile pollution levels and otherimpacts, and to hire more law enforcement officers. That money cannow be used to expand local economies. "The visiting public needs to be made awarethat tomorrow, next week, and throughout the winter they can continueto visit Yellowstone's popular attractions," Grimes said. "Skiersand snowshoers will return, and we think this can be a win-win casefor everyone. It's our hope that rather than being known as justthe 'snowmobile capitol of the world,' towns like West Yellowstonewill become known as the 'Winter Wonderland of the world.'"Other groups involved in the Yellowstone snowmobilecase are: Greater Yellowstone Coalition, National Parks ConservationAssociation, The Wilderness Society, Natural Resources Defense Council,and Sierra Club. The organizations were represented by Earthjustice.Grimes said Winter Wildlands plans to hold its annualskier rally for Yellowstone as scheduled this Valentine's Day. WWAexpects more than 300 skiers, snowshoers, and others to fill WestYellowstone hotels and restaurants over the long Presidents' Dayweekend, as they did last year, in a show of economic support forlocal businesses. WWA officials will also seek to meet with localbusiness leaders on how skiers can play a role in expanding thetown's winter economy.

The event took place over the weekendof October 3-5, 2003, and featured a climbing competition to benefitthe Access Fund, a film premier of Pilgrimage featuring Chris Sharma,a film presentation highlighting the biodiversity of the MohonkPreserve, a community clean-up service project, and a synergy oflocal and international climbers. Roc Trip drew over 400 climbersfor an open-levels bouldering competition that raised over $10,000for the Access Fund. Hank Alicandri, head ranger for the Mohonk Preserve,felt the event successfully reached climbers with a community message."Roc Trip was a great opportunity to speak to an audience made upprimarily of boulderers about important impact issues surroundingtheir sport," said Alicandri. At Saturday's clean up, athletes fromFrance and North America worked side-by-side with Petzl staff, removingseveral truckloads of trash from the climbing and overlook parkingareas. Sunday's climbing competition was organized intothree teams, pitting local climbers, European climbers, and NorthAmerican sponsored athletes against one another for the Access FundBenefit. Based on point system that converted climbing points intobenefit dollars, 316 locals prevailed on their home turf, raising$4,850, trailed by the Euro team of 11 raising $3,118 and the Americansfinishing third and contributing $2,275. The overall winner wasPetzl UK team athlete Steve McClure, with an individual score of695 points. Locals Rich Romano and Felix Mondugo each racked up315 points, and Ally Dory was the winner among local women, scoringa total of 106 points. "It's great to see over 400 people getting out thereclimbing and earning dollars for the Access Fund," said John DiCuollo,Petzl's Roc Trip coordinator. "Roc Trip is intended as a gatheringof international climbers, and this year's event proves that it'snot about how hard you climb, it's about community". Some notably difficult ascents took place at RocTrip, with Dave Graham putting up a new start to Euphoria , thefirst V12 bouldering problem at the Gunks, and British climber SteveMcClure on-sighting (leading the climb without falling) Survivalof the Fittest, a 5.13 traditional route climbed on natural protection.McClure also ascended Double Clutch with an extra degree of difficulty,by adding a sit-start upping the grade to V11. For festivities, local climber and filmmaker JoshLowell presented Pilgrimage, featuring Chris Sharma's boulderingjourney to Hampi, India. On Saturday night, Tim O'Neill, the "ClownPrince of Climbing", entertained an energetic crowd with his comedicperformance and a screening of "Climbing for Peas", followed byan after party attended by over 400 climbers. Rich Gottlieb, ownerof the local Rock & Snow climbing shop, was one of the local sponsorsthis year's Roc Trip. Rock & Snow had a record weekend in sales,and as a result, Gottlieb is donating an additional $1,000 to theAccess Fund. "This event generated a type of energy that empoweredeveryone to realize that they could do better, whether it's throughclimbing or in helping out the community," said Gottlieb. "Thisevent was, and felt, incredibly non-commercial. It's great thatPetzl is more focused on the community and the climbing than onprofiting from this gathering." In addition to the $10,000 for the Access Fund,Petzl and Rock and Snow contributed $4000 in cash and rescue equipmentto the Mohonk Preserve.

AccessFund.orgShelf Road Action Alert-- BLM Developing Travel Management Plan, COThe Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is developing a travel managementplan for off-road vehicles (ORVs) and other recreation use on 350,000acres of interspersed private, state, and BLM lands between CanonCity and Cripple Creek. This area is known as the Gold Belt TravelManagement Area, and it includes the Shelf Road climbing area. Lowpopulation and rugged terrain have kept most of these lands relativelypristine. However, the area has recently been discovered by growingnumbers of off-road vehicle users. ORV advocates are well organized,vocal and have been lobbying the BLM for greater access. Intensive ORV use will have an adverse effect onthe Shelf climbing experience, degrade wildlife habitat and waterquality, and increase noise pollution and soil erosion. The BLMis now in the process of deciding how much of the area will be availableto ORVs and how much will remain wild and provide solitude.The BLM has held two scoping meetings (to identifyimportant issues and develop alternatives) and is now in the processof developing the Travel Management Plan. Comments will be acceptedthroughout the planning process.

On Tuesday, U.S.District Judge Clarence Brimmer issued a temporary restraining orderthat suppresses a pending ban on snowmobiling in Yellowstone andGrand Teton national parks. Brimmer ruled that without the order,companies that rely on snowmobiling in the parks would suffer irreparableharm because of lost business.“I’m upset that [Brimmer’s] decisioncompletely ignores us skiers and snowshoers,” said Mack Brayfrom Jackson Hole, Wyoming. “We stay in hotels, eat in restaurants,and have money that is as green as anyone else’s. But we can’trecreate here in the midst of pollution and engine noise. Withouta ban, there’s just no point in us coming here.”A Dec. 16 ruling by U.S. District Court Judge EmmetSullivan reinstated a Clinton-era plan to phase out snowmobile usein Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks. The effect of thecourt’s ruling would have been to reduce snowmobile use inthe parks this year by half and eliminate snowmobile use next year.Many residents of the Park’s gateway communityof West Yellowstone expressed concerns that the Dec. 16 ruling wouldreduce winter tourism dollars. WWA’s event was to be an attemptat re-introducing human-powered winter recreationists to the park.Many skiers and snowshoers avoided Yellowstone in the winter becauseit was previously considered to be a haven of motorized recreation.Winter Wildlands expects the long-term effect ofa snowmobile ban in the parks to actually be an increase in tourismdollars as more user-groups flock to a safer, quieter, more pristineYellowstone, while snowmobilers continue to utilize the more than1,000 miles of snowmobile trails just outside the Park. WWA officialsestimated that the 105 attendees of their celebration pumped morethan $40,000 into local economies.“Skiers and snowshoers have told us they’reready to return to places like West Yellowstone and we’reconfident they’ll play a key role in expanding the community’stourism base, once snowmobile use is banned from our parks,”said WWA Executive Director Sally Grimes.With a complete phase-out of snowmobiles still scheduledfor next winter, Grimes said it is critical that the Park Service,Congress, local businesses and government leaders, and recreationorganizations like WWA work together to find new ways to draw morewinter visitors to West Yellowstone and other gateway communities.Winter Wildlands is calling for a modernization of the Yellowstonesnowcoach fleet and better education of the public on the diversewinter recreation opportunities in and around Yellowstone. Based in Boise, Idaho, Winter Wildlands representsmore than 19 million skiers, snowshoers, snowboarders, and othernon-motorized snowsports enthusiasts. It is the lone recreationgroup among the six plaintiffs in the federal lawsuit over the NationalPark Service’s winter use plan for Yellowstone and Grand Tetonnational parks.About Winter Wildlands AllianceFounded in 2000, Winter Wildlands Alliance promotes and preserveswinter wildlands and a quality human-powered snowsports experienceon public lands.

The fight for a clean, healthy, and quiet Yellowstoneis far from over and we are more energized than ever.As it did last Presidents Day weekend, Winter WildlandsAlliance is inviting members and supporters from across the UnitedStates to gather in Yellowstone on Valentines Day to voice theirsupport for the park. An estimated 300 supporters are expected toattend both a Friday night pre-rally reception and the main eventon Saturday morning just inside Yellowstones west entrance.The rally comes just four days after U.S. DistrictCourt Judge Clarence Brimmer in Wyoming blocked the phase-out ofsnowmobile use underway in Yellowstone by ruling in favor of thesnowmobile industry and the state of Wyoming. The snowmobile industryand the state are battling to keep snowmobiles in Yellowstone despiteNational Park Service studies that show the way to best protectthe park is to ban the machines. Winter Wildlands joined five nationaland regional conservation and environmental groups in fighting torestore the three-year-old snowmobile phase-out launched by theClinton administration but overturned by the Bush White House. U.S.District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan in Washington agreed with thecoalition in December, overturning the Bush administration planto allow more snowmobiles in Yellowstone and ordering the Park Serviceto begin the phase-out. That ruling was later upheld by an appellatepanel. But this week the Wyoming judge halted the phase-out, promptingthe Park Service to immediately begin allowing vastly more machinesinto the park than allowed so far this winter.The Park Services answer to this controversy isno answer at all, Grimes said. It is now allowing 780 machines intoYellowstone, up from the 493 that were allowed before this ruling.Those who have visited the park so far this winter have been amazedat how much quieter and cleaner it is this year. Now, we are backto business as usual. Yellowstone will be louder, dirtier, and lesshealthy this weekend than it was last weekend.This is Americas park, and Americans have spokenoverwhelmingly in favor of the snowmobile ban that the Park Servicesays is needed to protect Yellowstone. Instead of looking for waysto get more snowmobiles into Yellowstone, we should be focusingon finding the resources needed to get more visitors into the parkon snowcoaches, just as the Park Service suggested three years andmillions of dollars worth of studies ago.During the course of this weekend, Winter Wildlandswill be encouraging Yellowstone rally participants to redouble effortsto contact their elected officials in Washington and to step uplobbying on behalf of a snowmobile-free Yellowstone.Winter Wildlands has joined such groups as The WildernessSociety, National Parks Conservation Association, Greater YellowstoneCoalition, Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra Club, andthe Natural Trails and Waters Coalition in campaigning to removesnowmobiles from the two parks, as recommended by the Park Servicein 2000, before the Park Service reversed itself after being suedby the snowmobile industry.With thousands of miles of groomed snowmobile trailssurrounding Yellowstone, there are ample opportunities for snowmobilersto enjoy their sport without harming the park and ruining the visitorexperience. Founded in 2000 by grassroots groups throughoutthe country, Winter Wildlands Alliance is the only national organizationworking to protect a quality human-powered winter recreation experience.For more information, contact Sally Grimes, Executive Director,at 208.336.4203 or visit www.winterwildlands.org Note to Reporters: Winter Wildlands Alliance willbe posting photos for your use from Saturdays rally on our website(www.winterwildlands.org)by mid-afternoon Saturday.

He paused. "Man, they're allso awful," he said. "It'd be easier to give you a list that startedat bad and went down to very, very bad." . When movies meet mountains, bad cinema results.Consider "Vertical Limit" (2000), which finds mountaineering sodull that it adds nitroglycerin to the mix. Or "Cliffhanger" (1993),the Sylvester Stallone vehicle propelled by evildoers and stolenloot. The 1997 television adaptation of Jon Krakauer's Everest book,"Into Thin Air," proved so unwatchable that the rescued climbersprobably outnumbered the audience by the end. .

Hilotin, Staff ReporterAlain Roberts, the French Spiderman, will scale one of the six high-risesin Dubai Marina later this month as part of the Dubai Shopping Festivalspectacle. Roberts will attempt free-climbing the Murjan Tower (200metres, including spires) on January 29. Last year, Roberts caused a stir in Abu Dhabi whenhe climbed the National Bank of Abu Dhabi headquarters, drawingan estimated 100,000 spectators. The newly-minted Murjan Tower at Dubai Marina willbe an addition to Roberts' portfolio of over 60 skyscrapers andlandmarks worldwide, including Malaysia's Petronas Towers, the EiffelTower, the Empire State Building, and the straight-faced, glass-frontedSears Tower in Chicago. Roberts spent six days in a Tokyo jail after policeapprehended him for climbing the 225-metre Shinjuku Tower withouta rope, which horrified the Japanese police and fire brigade. He was originally sentenced to between two and sixmonths in jail but a TV channel caught a cop on TV punching Robertsin the face. "It was not that bad, the punch," recalled the Spiderman.But Emaar Properties, developers of Dubai Marina,have welcomed Roberts to climb one of its signature properties alongSheikh Zayed Road. Mansour Al Othaimin, corporate director of EmaarProperties, said: "Roberts brings a message of courage to Dubaiand is a great inspiration for us all. Emaar instantly recognisedhis dedication to achieve excellence, something that we can constantlystrive for in providing quality homes to the community." The Dubai Marina, situated next to the Dubai MediaCity and the Internet City, is a self-contained community carvedout of the desert edge with a 3.5 kilometre free-flowing canal thatwas later flooded with sea water. It is strategically located by Interchange 5, rightnext to the beach-front signature buildings such as the majesticBurj Al Arab and postcard perfect Jumeirah Beach Hotel. Emaar is one of the key sponsors of DSF 2004, whichstarts in seven days. Saeed Al Nabouda, CEO of the Dubai Shopping Festival,said: "There is no doubt that Emaar's participation in DSF willadd more value. They will be presenting many activities that canbe enjoyed by all members of every family of different nationalities."Roberts said climbing is his passion. He suffersfrom vertigo, and his accidents have partly disabled him. But hehas become the world's top solo climber. As a skilled motivational speaker, Roberts bringsa message of hope and inspiration to Dubai. "We set our limits,but we are all strong enough to aim higher, to achieve our goals.All we have to do is find such strength within ourselves and knowhow to develop it." http://www.gulf-news.com/Articles/news.asp?ArticleID=1074301/9/04 - REI and Black Diamond Present the 2004HERA Foundation Climb for Life Road TourNovice and expert climbers alike are invited to participate in theHERA (Health, Empowerment, Research, Advocacy) Foundation's 2004Climb for Life Road Tour, a fundraiser for ovarian cancer research.Participating REI stores and climbing gyms willhost a month-long climbing challenge: to climb as many indoor routesas possible within the designated time period.  Participants canhave friends and family sponsor them and the money raised will gotowards ovarian cancer research and treatment.

BOISE, ID - A federal court ruling against the Bush administration'ssnowmobile plan for Yellowstone National Park will create short-termhardship for some businesses outside Yellowstone, but will be aboon to others and presents a rare opportunity for towns such asWest Yellowstone to diversify their economies, the nation's firstand only organization representing non-motorized winter recreationistssaid. "We understand there will be some local economicdisruption as a result of this ruling, but we also know skiers andother winter recreation enthusiasts will flock to Yellowstone andits gateway communities once snowmobiles are no longer in the park,"said Winter Wildlands Alliance Executive Director Sally Grimes."Skiers have been telling us they're ready to return to placeslike West Yellowstone, and we're confident they'll play a key roleas the community expands its tourism base." Winter Wildlands, based in Boise, represents morethan 17 million skiers, snowshoers, snowboarders, and other non-motorizedsnowsports enthusiasts. It is the lone recreation group among thesix plaintiffs in the federal lawsuit over the National Park Service'swinter use plan for Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks.U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan on Wednesday set asidethe Park Service's plan to allow nearly 1,000 snowmobiles a dayinto Yellowstone and Grand Teton, reinstating a Clinton-era planto phase out snowmobile use in both parks. The effect of the court'sruling is to reduce snowmobile use in the parks this year by half,eliminating it next year. "The important thing for Yellowstone and forthose who want to enjoy its natural beauty in the winter is to moveahead as soon as possible toward replacing snowmobiles with moresnowcoaches to allow all Americans to visit Yellowstone in the winter,"Grimes said. "Yellowstone is not closed this winter, nor willit be closed next winter. All Americans will still enjoy accessto this special place. Now that the court has ruled, it's up toall of us to work with the Park Service and the communities surroundingthese magnificent parks to expand winter recreation opportunitiesin and around the parks." Grimes said it's critical that the Park Service,Congress, local businesses and government leaders, and snowmobileorganizations work together to find new ways to draw more wintervisitors to West Yellowstone and other gateway communities. Thatincludes askig Congress for more funds to expand the Yellowstonesnowcoach fleet and to better educate the public on diverse winterrecreation opportunities in and around Yellowstone. For instance,the Park Service was prepared to spend more than $1 million in taxdollars this winter to assess snowmobile pollution levels and otherimpacts, and to hire more law enforcement officers. That money cannow be used to expand local economies. "The visiting public needs to be made awarethat tomorrow, next week, and throughout the winter they can continueto visit Yellowstone's popular attractions," Grimes said. "Skiersand snowshoers will return, and we think this can be a win-win casefor everyone. It's our hope that rather than being known as justthe 'snowmobile capitol of the world,' towns like West Yellowstonewill become known as the 'Winter Wonderland of the world.'"Other groups involved in the Yellowstone snowmobilecase are: Greater Yellowstone Coalition, National Parks ConservationAssociation, The Wilderness Society, Natural Resources Defense Council,and Sierra Club. The organizations were represented by Earthjustice.Grimes said Winter Wildlands plans to hold its annualskier rally for Yellowstone as scheduled this Valentine's Day. WWAexpects more than 300 skiers, snowshoers, and others to fill WestYellowstone hotels and restaurants over the long Presidents' Dayweekend, as they did last year, in a show of economic support forlocal businesses. WWA officials will also seek to meet with localbusiness leaders on how skiers can play a role in expanding thetown's winter economy.

The event took place over the weekendof October 3-5, 2003, and featured a climbing competition to benefitthe Access Fund, a film premier of Pilgrimage featuring Chris Sharma,a film presentation highlighting the biodiversity of the MohonkPreserve, a community clean-up service project, and a synergy oflocal and international climbers. Roc Trip drew over 400 climbersfor an open-levels bouldering competition that raised over $10,000for the Access Fund. Hank Alicandri, head ranger for the Mohonk Preserve,felt the event successfully reached climbers with a community message."Roc Trip was a great opportunity to speak to an audience made upprimarily of boulderers about important impact issues surroundingtheir sport," said Alicandri. At Saturday's clean up, athletes fromFrance and North America worked side-by-side with Petzl staff, removingseveral truckloads of trash from the climbing and overlook parkingareas. Sunday's climbing competition was organized intothree teams, pitting local climbers, European climbers, and NorthAmerican sponsored athletes against one another for the Access FundBenefit. Based on point system that converted climbing points intobenefit dollars, 316 locals prevailed on their home turf, raising$4,850, trailed by the Euro team of 11 raising $3,118 and the Americansfinishing third and contributing $2,275. The overall winner wasPetzl UK team athlete Steve McClure, with an individual score of695 points. Locals Rich Romano and Felix Mondugo each racked up315 points, and Ally Dory was the winner among local women, scoringa total of 106 points. "It's great to see over 400 people getting out thereclimbing and earning dollars for the Access Fund," said John DiCuollo,Petzl's Roc Trip coordinator. "Roc Trip is intended as a gatheringof international climbers, and this year's event proves that it'snot about how hard you climb, it's about community". Some notably difficult ascents took place at RocTrip, with Dave Graham putting up a new start to Euphoria , thefirst V12 bouldering problem at the Gunks, and British climber SteveMcClure on-sighting (leading the climb without falling) Survivalof the Fittest, a 5.13 traditional route climbed on natural protection.McClure also ascended Double Clutch with an extra degree of difficulty,by adding a sit-start upping the grade to V11. For festivities, local climber and filmmaker JoshLowell presented Pilgrimage, featuring Chris Sharma's boulderingjourney to Hampi, India. On Saturday night, Tim O'Neill, the "ClownPrince of Climbing", entertained an energetic crowd with his comedicperformance and a screening of "Climbing for Peas", followed byan after party attended by over 400 climbers. Rich Gottlieb, ownerof the local Rock & Snow climbing shop, was one of the local sponsorsthis year's Roc Trip. Rock & Snow had a record weekend in sales,and as a result, Gottlieb is donating an additional $1,000 to theAccess Fund. "This event generated a type of energy that empoweredeveryone to realize that they could do better, whether it's throughclimbing or in helping out the community," said Gottlieb. "Thisevent was, and felt, incredibly non-commercial. It's great thatPetzl is more focused on the community and the climbing than onprofiting from this gathering." In addition to the $10,000 for the Access Fund,Petzl and Rock and Snow contributed $4000 in cash and rescue equipmentto the Mohonk Preserve.

AccessFund.orgShelf Road Action Alert-- BLM Developing Travel Management Plan, COThe Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is developing a travel managementplan for off-road vehicles (ORVs) and other recreation use on 350,000acres of interspersed private, state, and BLM lands between CanonCity and Cripple Creek. This area is known as the Gold Belt TravelManagement Area, and it includes the Shelf Road climbing area. Lowpopulation and rugged terrain have kept most of these lands relativelypristine. However, the area has recently been discovered by growingnumbers of off-road vehicle users. ORV advocates are well organized,vocal and have been lobbying the BLM for greater access. Intensive ORV use will have an adverse effect onthe Shelf climbing experience, degrade wildlife habitat and waterquality, and increase noise pollution and soil erosion. The BLMis now in the process of deciding how much of the area will be availableto ORVs and how much will remain wild and provide solitude.The BLM has held two scoping meetings (to identifyimportant issues and develop alternatives) and is now in the processof developing the Travel Management Plan. Comments will be acceptedthroughout the planning process. Please encourage the BLM to restrictORV use to existing roads, and most importantly, not to allow theiruse in or near the Shelf Road climbing area.

NSR of Western Canada - The Ben Albert Memorial AwardHowa carefully planned adventure to the B.C. backcountry became a tragedythat swept seven teens to their deaths.     It's a soft, gray morning. The ground is blanketed byeight centimeters of fresh snow. The temperature hovers around zero.      The past 24 hours have been avalanche-free,and Abby Watkins and Rich Marshall are eager to get in a day of backcountryskiing amid the mountainous sweep near the summit of Rogers Pass ineastern British Columbia.      They are not alone. The mountain guidesspot a school group getting ready to press ahead into the popularBalu Pass. Husband and wife pause to say hello.     "It's a beautiful day out here, isn'tit?" says Abby. "Yes," someone responds.      They leave the 14 teenagers and threeadults behind, climbing briskly until they stop for a break in a treedarea.      Abby looks back at the people belowand a gangly teen, all arms and legs, catches her eye. "Aren'tkids funny? Look at that kid," she tells Rich.      At that very moment, just before noonon Saturday, something gives way on the rugged north face of CheopsMountain. Abby and Rich hear a thunderous roar. They watch in horroras a torrent of snow hurtles to the valley, picking up speed and debris.The school group is directly in its path.      Rich screams: "Avalanche! Avalanche!Avalanche!"      The skiers look up.     Ben Albert is frantically trying to cram his day packinto a big black backpack already bulging with clothes, equipmentand enough food for a breakfast and stir-fry dinner for himself andthree other hungry 15-year-olds. He finally wedges it in and staggersout the door. It's early Friday morning.      His mother, Carol Neale, watches uneasilyas he and her husband Gerald pull out onto the road and head to theCanadian Tire parking lot on the western edge of Calgary. There, Benwill rendezvous with 13 other Grade 10 students from the elite Strathcona-Tweedsmuirprivate school for a long weekend of backcountry, telemark skiing,a difficult activity that combines cross-country and downhill.      The trip is the culmination of twomonths of intense training and the most arduous yet of the school'scelebrated, year-long outdoor education program.      Despite the early hour, the excitementamong the 11 boys and three girls is infectious. Michael Shaw is sokeyed up he talked the night away with his younger sister Kathryn.She tried to get him to go to bed but he just kept talking.      They are close, these healthy, strong,accomplished 15-year-olds. Many have grown up together.      Michael and his best pal Taylor Carcasoleare there, in one of two vans that will take everyone to Rogers Pass.The two are inseparable. Teachers know them as "mischief."Taylor is the "mis," and Michael the "chief."      Ben Albert sees Scott Broshko and JeffTrickett. They are three parts of a group of four talented teens knownas the "Fearsome Foursome."      Scott has been talking about the expeditionalmost nonstop since training began. Outdoor trips are his passion.For his birthday, he asked for a sleeping bag.      The night before, Daniel Arato bombardedhis older brother Thomas with excited questions about what to take.      His father had left a day earlier forhis own ski trip. The two exchanged kisses and hugs. Mr. Arato toldhis son to keep his head in the game and do what he's told. As thetwo parted, Daniel told his dad: "I love you."      The leader of the expedition is teacherAndrew Nicholson, a skilled and experienced skier, well-trained inavalanche awareness. He is so demanding in checking snow conditionsthat previous groups have dubbed him "Nazi Nick."      Parents have signed waivers protectingthe school in the event of deaths or injuries, but Carol Neale isworried. She can't stop thinking about an avalanche less than twoweeks before that killed seven experienced backcountry skiers just40 kilometers away from where Ben and his classmates are headed.      Scott Broshko's mother, Donna, knowsabout that avalanche, too. But she thinks: "What is the likelihood?Just what is the likelihood of that?"      She gives him a quick hug. He'll beback on Monday.      It's a four-hour journey to Glacier National Park. Thewinding, 350-kilometre drive along the Trans-Canada Highway west fromCalgary offers some of the most stunning views in the country, repletewith neck-craning mountain walls and stomach-churning sheer dropsto valleys below.      Along the way are warning signs forfallen rocks and avalanche debris. Runaway lanes for truckers wholose their brakes on the steep inclines are common.      Even more ominous are five long avalanchetunnels protecting the highway from the walls of snow that regularlycut loose from the steep upper slopes surrounding Rogers Pass.      With an annual average snowfall ofup to 21 meters, the area has one of the deadliest concentrationsof avalanches in the world -- enough to keep an on-site military unitstationed there, equipped with explosives and howitzers to bring downthreatening avalanches before they become dangerous.      The vans arrive at the park about noon,and the STS expedition wastes no time heading for its weekend headquarters,the A.O. Wheeler Hut, an easy two-kilometer trek from the highway.The A-frame log building, complete with two wood stoves and propanesystems for cooking and light, is nestled in a cedar forest. The cabinsleeps 24 in three rooms.      The teenagers stow their large packsand, after exacting tests of snow conditions by Mr. Nicholson, theystart to ski, exhilarated by liberation from school on a Friday afternoonand giddy with the fresh mountain air.      That evening, exhausted from theirwonderful afternoon, the students are divided into groups. Each preparesits own dinner. Marissa Staddon and her group pig out on chocolatefondue. Scott Broshko's dines on quesadillas, much to the envy ofanother group grumpily making do with Hamburger Helper.      Through the night, snoring from Scottand his pal Jeff Trickett keeps some of the 11 boys in the same roomfrom sleeping.      By the time they wake Saturday morning,Parks Canada has already posted its avalanche bulletin for backcountryskiers. In tree-line and alpine areas, the avalanche risk has beenassessed as "considerable," the mid-range of the five possibleratings.      Below the tree line, the risk is assessedas "moderate," with natural avalanches unlikely. And theSTS group intends to stay below the tree line throughout its telemarkexpedition to Balu Pass.      But the bulletin also refers to weaksnow layers left over from early winter snowfalls that have failedto stabilize. There were similar references for the same mountainrange in avalanche bulletins last month, just before the deadly slidethat claimed seven lives near Revelstoke, B.C.      The group makes its way to the RogersPass information building, a macaroni-shaped structure with a sodand timber roof, to pore over the latest information. Mr. Nicholsongoes inside. He asks about conditions in several areas before headingback to the students and two other adults -- a fellow teacher anda chaperone.     The group decides it is safe to ski that day. By 10:15 a.m., theyare on the trailhead to the pass, five kilometers away, describedby backcountry enthusiasts as an easy, but beautiful trail. They skithrough forest, along a rocky creek, over a snow-covered bridge andinto the Connaught Creek valley. Surrounded by mountains and deeppowder snow, the scenery is breathtaking.      Reminders of past avalanches are everywhere.Relentless slides tearing down either side of the valley over theyears have littered the area with rocks and stumps. Foliage is sparseon the valley floor.      The school group successfully crossesfour avalanche-prone paths on the north side of the valley, and threeon the south side. They note that the debris from one avalanche pathacross the valley is no more than a week old.      They are halfway to their destination.      The guide's frantic warning comes too late. The avalanchehits them head on.      In a matter of seconds, all 17 skiersare swept away in a huge, terrifying tangle of snow, rocks and trees.      The swiftness and power of the avalanchesounds like a freight train moving at high speeds, Abby thinks. "Ahuge roar. The power of that much snow moving at the accelerationof gravity and propagating more and more snow on the way. . . . Nobodycould have got out of the way. Nobody."Avalanche Spread     The river-rush of snow engulfs the skiers, then separates them. Asection of the slide breaks away and keeps going, carrying a numberof victims hundreds of meters down the valley. Disoriented and tumblinghead over foot with little chance to "swim" to the surface,this unlucky group ends up as much as 4.5 meters beneath the concrete-hardsnow.      Up in the trees, Abby and Rich aredusted by a thick cloud of powder. A terrible silence falls over thevalley. Though their hearts are thumping, they shut down their emotions.On goes the search-and-rescue switch, one they have trained for yearsto put into practice.      They race down to the first group ofburied skiers. The only sign of life is an odd hand and a few legspoking through the snow. The others, in the toe of the slide at thebottom of the valley, are buried much deeper.      Alone at the scene, the husband-and-wifeteam is faced with heartbreaking decisions. Who to save first?      Not everybody would make it, they reason.But those trapped near the top would have a better shot at survival.      Rich runs for the first hand he seesand begins digging. It's Andrew Nicholson. He finds Mr. Nicholson'sshovel so the group leader can dig himself out, and moves on. Mr.Nicholson has a satellite phone and calls for help.      But for the next 45 minutes, exceptfor the victims, Rich and Abby are there by themselves, working tofree as many as they can from their tombs of suffocating snow. Theguides' transceivers work perfectly, honing in with beeps and flashinglights on the buried skiers equipped with their own avalanche beacons,like shouts from the grave.      The couple follows the rules of avalancherescue like clockwork. Only dig to a victim to make sure he or sheis breathing. Clear snow from the victim's face. No CPR before movingon to the next victim. There are too many. Let survivors dig themselvesout.      Once free, the numb and distraughtliving do their best to help. Taylor Carcasole is frantic. His bestfriend Michael Shaw is missing. "Where's Michael? Where's Michael?"      The victims are scattered beneath thesnow. Rich and Abby split up to cover as much ground as possible.The first five people they pull out survive. Those survivors go onto rescue others. Everyone else Abby and Rich uncover is dead.      The grim lottery of who shall liveand who shall die is over. Seven students make it. Seven do not.      An hour after the avalanche, sevenhelicopters, three dogs and more than 30 individuals are on site.By 1:30 p.m., the final victim has been dug out. One survivor, witha broken ankle, is tobogganed out and airlifted to hospital. The remainingsurvivors are transported by helicopter to the cafeteria of the parkwarden's station. The bodies go, too. They are laid out on mats ina makeshift morgue in the same building.      Chuck Purse, Revelstoke's part-timecoroner, is investigating his second seven-death avalanche withintwo weeks. He examines each body in turn. None show signs of majorinjury. They were simply swept away and buried, dying from asphyxiation.      The bodies are wrapped in blankets,put in body bags and taken to the local Brandon Bowers Funeral Chapel.Co-owner Gary Sulz sends ordinary vans to collect the bodies becausehe thinks the sight of a fleet of hearses will upset the survivors.      Back in Calgary, news of the tragedybegins rippling through the close-knit community of parents by lateafternoon.      Donna and Dave Broshko are just leavingfor evening mass when Strathcona-Tweedsmuir head Tony Macoun callsto tell them there's been an accident. He says there are fatalities.He doesn't say who has died.      Mrs. Broshko immediately phones BenAlbert's mother, Carol Neale. Ben and Scott have been classmates sinceelementary school. "Carol, have you heard? There's been an accident."     "What are you talking about? No!"she screams. "I told him I didn't want him to go . . . I didn'twant him to go."      At the Arato home, Peter, skiing thatweekend at Big White in Kelowna, B.C., is talking to his wife whenher cell-phone rings. A friend has heard news reports of a tragedywhere their son Daniel was skiing. Mr. Arato soon learns from theradio that seven are dead from a school near Okotoks, where his boy'sschool is. He thinks the odds will not be in his favour.      The parents are told to go to the school.Judith Arato makes the 30-kilometre drive alone. She calls Peter inhysterics. Daniel is dead. Mr. Arato's friends charter a plane andsend him home.      Carol Neale's worst fears are confirmedthe moment she arrives at Strathcona-Tweedsmuir. As she steps insidethe foyer, another mother stops her. "I've heard from my son,"she tells Ms. Neale, relief written all over her face.     "I haven't heard from my son,"replies Ms. Neale. Minutes later, Tony Macoun tells her why. Ben isdead.     Mrs. Broshko, meanwhile, is panic-stricken, a horrible sinking feelingin the pit of her stomach. She can't stand not knowing. She phonesthe RCMP in Revelstoke. No luck. She phones Glacier Park Lodge, begginga clerk to go across the highway where the survivors are to see ifher Scotty is alive.     "Oh, please, please, please, go acrossthe road for me. I will be forever in your debt. Tell me that my sonis there."      The woman agrees. She phones back.No one will tell her anything.      Finally, the anguished couple headfor the school. They are ushered in to see Mr. Macoun. "It'ssuch a tragedy," he begins.     "I don't want to hear about the tragedy.Just tell me about Scott," Mrs. Broshko says.      Mr. Macoun says: "I'm very sorry.Scott's gone."      That night, Donna Broshko sleeps with apicture of Scott and her taken just before he went to the school'sformal Christmas dance. He is wearing his dad's suit and tie. Hisfather wore the same suit and tie at Scott's funeral on Thursday.     Skiers are soon back on the same Connaught Creek trail where lastweek's avalanche claimed its bright young victims. They ask offhandedlyabout "the morgue," worried that the jagged debris may betricky to cross.      Not far from the trailhead lies a wreath,with two ski poles stuck upright in the snow. Names of the dead 15-year-olds-- Jeff Trickett, Scott Broshko, Daniel Arato, Ben Albert, MarissaStaddon, Michael Shaw and Alex Pattillo -- are listed on the wreath,with the epigraph "Your Youth Will Be Eternal."      Farther along the path one glimpsesa more somber memorial: the deadly toe of the avalanche. At the bottomof the valley are three pits. They are several meters deep, a meteracross, and not far apart. Three burial holes left behind, and noone has filled them in.Timetableof tragedy OnSaturday, Feb. 1, 14 Grade 10 students from Strathcona-TweedsmuirSchool south of Calgary, set out on a backcountry ski trip up theBalu Pass in Glacier National Park, B.C. At around 11:45 a.m., theywere caught in an avalanche that killed seven of them. Here is thesequence of events on that day.1. Before departing, the leaders checked with theNational Park staff for current avalanche conditions. They were advisedthat the threat of avalanches was moderate below the tree line andconsiderable above it. Students were equipped with personal avalanchebeacons, probes and shovels. At 8:40 a.m., students left A.O. WheelerHut by van and headed to Rogers Pass Information Center, where theyconducted at least one test for avalanche risk.2. 10:15 a.m.: Commencement of trip up the Balu Passtrail. Following standard procedure, the one teacher led and the otheradult leaders followed at the rear of the skiers, who were 15 metresfrom each other.3. 11:45 a.m.: About halfway up the valley, an avalancheslid off the ridge of Cheops Mountain burying the group. Two skiersabout 200 meters ahead helped rescue the teacher in the lead who contactedwardens by satellite phone. 12:30 p.m.: Six students were reported alive.12:45 p.m.: Wardens arrive.4. 1:30 p.m.: All students were accounted for, includingthe seven who lost their lives.1.45 p.m.: One of the students was tobogganed backto the motel with a broken ankle. Meanwhile, helicopters joined therescue and airlifted students to the motel parking lot, from wherethey were transported to a private home in Revelstoke.Howthe avalanche happened    A small slide began high up on the ridge of Cheops Mountain, abovethe south side of Connaught Creek Valley. This set off a huge secondslide that crashed into the valley bottom with such force that itrode high up the opposite wall as it was redirected eastward downthe valley, burying the group of skiers.Copyright1995 - 2003.

Three burial holes left behind, and noone has filled them in.Timetableof tragedy OnSaturday, Feb. 1, 14 Grade 10 students from Strathcona-TweedsmuirSchool south of Calgary, set out on a backcountry ski trip up theBalu Pass in Glacier National Park, B.C. At around 11:45 a.m., theywere caught in an avalanche that killed seven of them. Here is thesequence of events on that day.1. Before departing, the leaders checked with theNational Park staff for current avalanche conditions. They were advisedthat the threat of avalanches was moderate below the tree line andconsiderable above it. Students were equipped with personal avalanchebeacons, probes and shovels. At 8:40 a.m., students left A.O. WheelerHut by van and headed to Rogers Pass Information Center, where theyconducted at least one test for avalanche risk.2. 10:15 a.m.: Commencement of trip up the Balu Passtrail. Following standard procedure, the one teacher led and the otheradult leaders followed at the rear of the skiers, who were 15 metresfrom each other.3. 11:45 a.m.: About halfway up the valley, an avalancheslid off the ridge of Cheops Mountain burying the group. Two skiersabout 200 meters ahead helped rescue the teacher in the lead who contactedwardens by satellite phone. 12:30 p.m.: Six students were reported alive.12:45 p.m.: Wardens arrive.4. 1:30 p.m.: All students were accounted for, includingthe seven who lost their lives.1.45 p.m.: One of the students was tobogganed backto the motel with a broken ankle. Meanwhile, helicopters joined therescue and airlifted students to the motel parking lot, from wherethey were transported to a private home in Revelstoke.Howthe avalanche happened    A small slide began high up on the ridge of Cheops Mountain, abovethe south side of Connaught Creek Valley. This set off a huge secondslide that crashed into the valley bottom with such force that itrode high up the opposite wall as it was redirected eastward downthe valley, burying the group of skiers.Copyright1995 - 2003.

History of MacombMacomb Area Chamber of Commerce& Downtown Development Corporation214 N Lafayette Street - P.O. Box 274Macomb, IL 61455309-837-4855  Economic Development - Macomb Area Info - Members - Events - Area Maps - History of MacombCommunity Overview - Business After Hours - Membership Info History of MacombThe history of Macomb, located on the old “Burlington Trail” to Burlington, Iowa, is inextricably interwoven with that of McDonough County whose majestic courthouse dominates Macomb’s square. Both the city and the county were named for heroes of the War of 1812, General Alexander Macomb and Commodore McDonough, who later defeated the British at Lake Champlain. The whole area was part of what was termed the Military tract, grants of land set aside for those who volunteered for service in the War of 1812. For a while, McDonough county, as it’s known, was part of Madison and then a part of Pike Counties until its present boundaries were set up in 1826. Even then, though the county had it’s name and boundaries, its administration and tax collection were left in the hands of Schuyler County officials until the new county chould gain a population of 350.In the spring of 1829 Reverend John Baker, a Baptist Minister, built the first log cabin on the site of the present city of Macomb. This building stood about where the old high school stood, at the corner of West Jefferson and South Johnson Streets. The cabin was not far from the exact center of McDonough County, which is at the corner of West Piper and South Johnson Streets. In 1830 a court order issued at Rushville recognized that the county had the necessary population for county government and an election for county commissioners was ordered held. These commissioners held the “seat of justice” at the hut of John Baker, then the only house standing. In December of 1830, James Clarke was sent to Springfield to get the tile of the quarter section of which the Baker house was located. He did this, getting caught in a terrible snowstorm on his way back, and receiving the sum of three dollars for his trouble.The Baker house was built of logs plastered with ordinary mud and served as tavern, grocery, courthouse, and clerk’s office until a new courthouse was built. The site had been given the tentative name of Washington, but the state legislature, meeting in Vandalia in December, 1830, passed an act locating the county seat for McDonough and giving this county seat the name of Macomb.Three courthouses have been built in different stages in Macomb’s history, all being erected at the same location where the present one stands today. The first courthouse, made of logs, was built in 1831 at a cost of under $70.00. The second building, erected in 1838, was a brick structure costing around $8,000.00. In 1860, Judge C.L. Higbee was addressing a political meeting at the courthouse when the building began to crack. The crowd dispersed very quickly, and after that, it was almost impossible to retain any audience. Construction for the present courthouse began in 1868. Together with its furnishings, the present structure cost around $155,00.Education in Macomb began in 1834 when a one-room log school house was opened as a private school. Each pupil’s tuition cost his parents one dollar in cash and three dollars in merchandise or produce. In 1835 McDonough College was established. The undertaking proved a failure as did four successive attempts by various groups. All were short lived. Finally, in 1899 Western State Normal School, now known as Western Illinois University was established on a campus of approximately seventy acres on the edge of the city.Before streets and roads were paved, people were often forced to use “mudboats” like scows, drawn by mules or oxen, to come to town, since no horse-drawn vehicles could get through the deep mud.One of the early industries of Macomb was the Tinsley Flour Mill, where such excellent flour was made that it was sold quite extensively, much of it in St. Louis. Flour was then sold in barrels, and the Tinsley Mill located on South Randolph Street, had its own copper shop and made its own barrels. Other early industries included a brick manufacturing plant and woolen mill.

 MARKHAM FAMILY HISTORY MARKHAMThe noble Markham line can be traced to well before 1066.Alexander Markham, born 1130, was the first man of note - havingdistinguished himself in the wars of King Stephen. He was castellan orSheriff of Nottingham during the reign of Richard I and into that ofJohn - the period of Robin Hood. His great grandson, William theBishop of Wells, was Lord Treasurer of England from 1290 to 1295.Three generations later, John - a Judge of CommonPleas, put the Prince of Wales in prison after the Prince slapped him.See Shakespeare's "Henry the IV", Part two, Act 1, scenetwo, for a mention of this. This Sir John became Lord Chief Justice ofEngland from 1396-1406.  In 1470 Sir Robert, who fought on the side ofthe White Roses, was Sheriff of Nottingham as were several of hisdescendants.  Sir Robert, born 1536 was a M.P. in 1571 and HighSheriff in 1571 and 1589. Sir Robert, born 1563, was knighted by JamesI on May 11, 1603 and squandered the family fortune and its estate ofCotham.  Sir Clements Markham speculated that Daniel Markham of Cambridge,MASS, alive in 1667 was Robert's grandson through either Robert born 1596 orAlexander born 1601.  Traditionally, Daniel came to America on thefirst ship after the Mayflower, the "Speedwell", as one ofits 5 unknown passengers. He was a Deacon in 1690.Mark Goodmansen, who may be contacted at MGoodmanse@aol.com, has done thefollowing truly great research on the first Markham in America. The followingis reproduced with his kind permission.The purpose of this article is to present the English roots of Deacon DanielMarkham of Massachusetts and Connecticut based on research developed over thelast several years. The authority for my conclusions are based primarily on acourt case in Massachusetts where Daniel Markham was deposed as a witnessregarding the sale of a horse.  Additionally, a will of a kinsman written inLondon in 1639 further corroborates this conclusion. Other sources arereferenced to clarify or support the original sources.In the fertile soil of the Colne River Valley lies the quaint town of EarlsColne. The parish records originating there identify these two families:James Markham married Martha Collins on October 11, 1632They had the following children:1. James - Baptized April 16342. Margaret - Baptized Aug 18, 16363. John - Baptized Feb 21, 16384. Daniel - Baptized June 22, 16415. William - Baptized  June 22, 16456. Martha - Baptized Mar 21, 16467. Mathew  - Baptized 16498. Phoebe - Baptized April 3, 1655Abraham Markham married Alice Turner, also of Earls Colne, and had severalchildren, one of whom was Nathaniel Markham, born in 1642.The noted historian, J. Gardner, in his article, The English Ancestral Homesof the Founders of Cambridge, estimated from his research that nearlytwo-thirds of the early English colonists were from Suffolk, Essex, andHertfordshire Counties. He also observed:"The early founders of New England did not generally come here at random bymere families and locate haphazard in the various settlements. On thecontrary, the colonization was in large parties of families, relatives, andfriends who had been acquainted and associated in England, emigrated togetherunder the leadership of their respective non-conforming ministers, andlocated together in New England."The Rev. Thomas Shepherd, like Rev. Hooker, became an active proponent forthe Puritan cause. From 1627 to 1631, he was a lecturer in Earls Colne, Essexand generated a large following.  Having been silenced by Archbishop Laud, heremoved to Yorkshire and Northumberland.  During his last few years inEngland, as recorded in his diary, he stayed for a time with the Russell,Collins, and Harlakendon families in and around Ipswitch and Earls Colne.On the ship, The Defence, the Rev. Shepherd with several parishioners,including John Russell and Roger Harlakendon, set sail for New England in1635. Accompanying them in this settlement was Mr. Edward Collins.Edward Collins went on to establish himself in nearby Medford, where heacquired Gov. Craddock's massive estate, and later sold 1600 acres of hisplantation to Richard Russell. The first preserved documentation from Englandthat Daniel Markham, born in June 1641, in Earls Colne, was the same as theCambridge, Mass. Resident is provided by the will of a Daniel Collins,written in 1639 and probated in 1643. In it, he leaves fifty pounds Britishcurrency to "the wife of Cousin Markham." In the same will, he mentions hisbrother, Samuel, Vicar of Braintree, and Edward Collins, "now in NewEngland," and names several children of Edward Collins.He also mentioned his mother was buried at Braintree. The town of Braintreeis in Essex, next to Earls Colne. Daniel Collins referred to "the lease ofthe Dolphin." There is property named, "The Dolphin, in Halstead, which alsoborders Earls Colne. This property is mentioned in the records of Earls Colnin association with other plots of ground, which have been identified withJames Markham, which also was held by a John Collins prior to James Markham.In 1670, Daniel Markham, then also of Medford, Mass., was deposed to testifyon behalf of Edward Collins, plaintiff, involving an alleged theft of a mareand colt by a neighbor. During his testimony, he, Daniel, on severaloccasions referred to Mr. Collins as his uncle. The court reporter mentionedthat the deponent, Daniel Markham, "was aged 25 years or thereabouts," whichis consistent with the christening records of Earls Colne, which would puthim at the age of 27 at this time. (Court records of Middlesex County, Mass)By his own words, as recorded in the Mass. Court records, Daniel Markhamidentifies his uncle Edward Collins. From England, Daniel Collins, in hiswill, identifies his cousin Markham (referring to James Markham and his wifeMartha Collins) and his relative, Edward Collins, in New England. And, inEarls Colne, Essex, we have documented the marriage of James Markham andMartha Collins, who had a son, Daniel, born in 1641.During the course of his life, various incidents further corrororate theserelationships. These include the following:1) Daniel Markham named his second son, James (after his father), and adaughter Martha (after his mother). Naming children after parents was commonpractice then.2) On March 29, 1675, Daniel Markham purchased two acres of land in Medfordfrom Edward Collins. (From the Medford Mass. Land Records, Salt Lake FamilyHistory Center Microfilm #532455; V.6; pages 240-249)3) After the death of his first wife, Elizabeth, he removed to Middletown,Conn., and married Patience Harris. His neighbors in Middletown includedSamuel and the Rev. Nathaniel Collins. Both of them were sons of EdwardCollins of Cambridge, Mass.4) On the church records of Middletown, Daniel Markham was presented to thatcongregation on June 25, 1678. He was identified as having been from thecongregation of the Church of Christ at Cambridge. This is the same churchwhere Rev. Hooker began, and was replaced by Rev. Shepherd, who hadpreviously preached in Earls Colne, England. (From the Middletown ChurchRecords, Salt Lake Family History Library, Microfilm #4848, page 12)5) Daniel Markham loaned money to Samuel Collins. Samuel Collins providedthat Daniel Markham conduct an inventory of his possessions upon his death.(Digest of Early Conn. Probate Records, V.1, pages 429-430)6) Nathaniel Markham of Charlestown, Mass. Died Sept 26, 1673 in the home ofMr. Collins. (Charlestown Vital Records; Vol 1; Part 1; page 22). The parishrecords of Earls Colne, Essex, England, list a Nathaniel Markham, born May30, 1642 to Abraham Markham and Alice Turner Markham. Being near the sameage, and from the same town, it seems likely that Daniel and Nathanielemigrated together. Possibly, because of the kinship of Daniel and Nathanieland the kinship of Daniel and Edward Collins, Nathaniel was befriended by Mr.Collins until his death in 1673.In conclusion, I believe that the above clearly establishes that DeaconDaniel Markham of Cambridge, Mass. And Middletown Conn. was the son of JamesMarkham and Martha Collins, of Earls Colne, and that he was born in 1641.During the last few years I have been trying to find the answer to the nextobvious question. Does Deacon Daniel descend from the royal Markham family ofNottinghamshire?My research, while in England, and from various locations and sources in theUnited States, has identified several, very strong clues that support that hedid descend from a known branch of the Markham family of Nottinghamshire. Ihope to be able to publish these findings soon, but I would like to find moredocumentation first.  I also intend to publish a biography of Deacon DanielMarkham, including some extremely fascination new information about him whilein England and in the colonies.This research makes the previous speculations about connection to the nobleMarkham line more problematic.The brother ofEbenezer, our ancestor, was Jeremiah, born 1735 and owner of all shipironworks in CT.

One For AllOne For All ...by Ann Douglas        Stepping into the building vestibule,Stephanie Morgan shook the water from herumbrella. It had only been a little over two blockwalk from the bus stop, but she had gotten soakednevertheless. Opening her raincoat, the 24 yearold blond made an attempt to shake that dry aswell.        It had been bad luck that her brotherJerry’s car had picked tonight of all nights not tostart up.  He had promised to drop her off at herfriend Rachel’s new apartment. No matter, shereluctantly concluded, at least she was here now.        "Lets see,"  she mused as she ran herfinger across the row of intercom buttons."Alexander ... Markham ... Ford ...  here it is,Lieberman, 5B"        It took a few moments to get a response,then a semi-distorted voice filtered through thespeaker.        "Hello?"  the female voice asked.        "Rachel, it’s me Stef."  she replied.        "Come on up," Rachel said as the buzzersounded and the inner door unlocked.  "I’m in theshower."          "She’s in the shower?"  Stephanie laughedas she glanced back out into the rain coveredstreet.         As she walked up the stairs to the fifthfloor apartment, Stephanie couldn’t help but envyher girlfriends new accommodations.  To someonestill living at home, the small apartment complexmight has well been a palace. There was no waythe salesgirl could afford a place like this on hersalary.          Of course Rachel really couldn’t afford aplace like this on her salary either.  The buildingwas owned by Martin Lieberman, who whenasked by his widowed sister-in-law to help herdaughter find an apartment was more than happyto find her this one.  It was a small thing to makea woman he’d admired for years happy.  Besides,having his niece living here assured him a honestpair of eyes to watch over his investment.         Reaching the fifth floor of the smallapartment building, Stephanie found that therewere some limits to Mr. Lieberman's generosityafter all.  Apartment 5B was a small studioapartment, one of three on the top floor.  Tryingthe door, she found it unlocked and steppedinside.        "Rachel," the blue eyed blond called out asshe closed the door behind her.        "I'm in here, Stef," came a reply from the bathroom, a voice much more recognizable thanthe one that had come over the intercom.  "Makeyourself comfortable and  I'll be out in a fewminutes."            Hanging her coat, on the rack by the door,Stephanie checked the short red dress she waswearing.  It was a little damp but otherwise okay.She had gotten home late and didn’t have time tochange clothes.          As she waited, Stephanie took in hersurroundings.  The apartment might be small, butit had a certain charm.  The first feature shenoticed were large twin skylights in the ceiling. The soft patter of rain could be heard againstthem.  On a clear day or night, they would give anice natural light to the room.        On the far left, a large bay window alsoadded to the natural light.  The view beyond itwas nothing special, but it was a nice feature.  A kitchenette over by the bathroom entranceconsisted of a small refrigerator, a stovetop and microwave. And of course a kitchen sink.        There really wasn't much in the way ofdecoration on the walls, but then Rachel had onlybeen living there a few weeks.  The center of theroom was dominated by a large green oversizedU-shaped sofa.  In addition to the deep cushions,it was covered with equally push and oversizedpillows.  Rachel had mentioned to her that sheused the sofa in place of a bed.        At the open end of the couch was one ofthose small self assembly entertainment centers, the bottom of  which was filled with her friend'sold stereo system . What was new was the large35-inch color television, a housewarming gift fromRachel's grandmother.  The couch had been onefrom her mother.        On both sides of the television were someframed photographs.  One brought a smile toStephanie’s face. The 5 x 7 picture was veryfamiliar to the 24 year old.  A smaller version wasstuck in the mirror frame in her own bedroom. The picture had been taken last summer at theOakdale Mall Talent Show.        Centered in the picture was Rachel ofcourse.  She always had to be the center ofattention.  To her right was Stephanie herself.That was when her hair had been down toher shoulders, rather than the short curly look shenow wore.        To Rachel's left was a much smaller girl,whose mixed Philippine, Chinese and Spanishheritage had given her a soft brown complexion. Her very short black hair and unisex featuresgave her an androgynous look.  In fact, if it wasn'tfor the small mounds protruding from her chest,she might've been mistaken for a teenage boy. Her name was Annie Liu, but everyone called herPenny.  Despite her teenage looks, she was 20years old.        The last member of the quartet was a tallblack woman standing just behind and to theleft of Rachel. Five foot ten, she stood half a headtaller than any of the others, more than that inthe case of Penny's five two. Her skin was ebonyblack, a sharp contrast to both Rachel andStephanie.  Most men first noticed her somewhatample bust.  In the case of women it was her jetblack hair which she usually wore in an elaboratedesign.  At 26, Pamela Wilson was the oldestmember of their little band.        All four women worked at the OakdaleMall. Rachel was a medical assistant.  Stephaniewas a sales representative at one of the large department stores.  Penny worked at her unclesrestaurant. She was also a college student. Pamela was the associate manager of  an officesupply store.        Despite their differences in ages andbackgrounds, they had all become friends overcountless shared lunches.  Soon their friendshipshad extended beyond work.  The picture hadcaptured one of the highlights of that friendship. Billing themselves as the Four Musketeers, sonamed because those were the only costumes theycould find, they had entered the talent showas a singing group.  It was more fun than hardwork and the money went to charity.  To theirsurprise, they finished in second place.  Since thenthey still jokingly referred to themselves as theFour Musketeers.        "We'd have gotten first,"  Stephaniethought as she replaced the picture on theentertainment center. "If we paraded around halfnaked like Judy Peterman.  The judges weremore impressed by her big nipples stickingthrough her blouse than her singing."        "Any sign of the rain letting up?"  Rachelasked as she walked out of the bathroom.        "No, it looks like tonight’s a totalwashout."  Stephanie replied as she turned aroundat the sound of her voice.        "A pity."  Rachel commented as shewalked over to Stephanie and kissed her on thecheek as a friendly hello.        Covered only by a large bath towel thatshe had wrapped around herself, Rachel walkedover to a large dresser that lined the far wall, stilldrying her hair as she walked.        "It really sucks that it had to rain tonight" Rachel said , pulling a pair of panties and anoversized T-shirt from the top drawer.  "I waslooking forward to that concert."        The original plan for the evening was for agirls night out.  One of their favorite local bandswas holding an open air concert in Marshall Park.They'd planned to take dinner a couple of blanketsand a few bottles of wine out to enjoy the music. Unfortunately Mother Nature had other ideas.  Sorather than let the night go to waste, they haddecided to have a girl's night in instead.        "Penny and Pamela are picking up thefood." Rachel said as she unwrapped the towelfrom around her and let it fall to the floor.  "I'mnot sure what they're getting, but knowing Pamelait's sure to be something interesting." she added asshe stood there nude as the day she was born.        "I guess so." Stephanie replied in anstrained tone.        Silly as she knew it was, Stephanie felt it alittle strange for her friend to be standing nude infront of her as they continued their conversation. It wasn't of course the first time she'd seen Rachelnaked.  They'd gone to the beach many times, aswell as clothes shopping both together and as partof the group.  They'd shared dressing rooms manytimes, but somehow it now seemed different --somewhat out of context maybe, standing nakedin the living room.  Then she reminded herself thatthis was also Rachel's bedroom, a place where itwas perfectly natural for her to be nude.        Stephanie also considered that she feltuncomfortable because when they'd first met,Rachel and she had almost the same physicalbuild, the main difference being Rachel's darkerbrown hair and slightly larger breasts.  Thatdifference had grown to more than a few poundsof extra weight on Stephanie. Despite assurancesfrom many of her friends that she looked betterwith the extra weight, which was still within thenorm for her size, she always felt self-consciousabout it. It was an outgrowth of her teen yearswhen she had actually been overweight.        It didn't take Rachel long to put on thepair of panties and the T-shirt she had taken out.Since she was home and not planning to go out,she didn't see the need for anything more.  Withher breasts still a little damp, Rachel's much darkernipples clearly showed through the thin cotton.        "Judy Peterman would’ve been  proud." Stephanie thought with a laugh as her discomfortpassed.        Fifteen minutes passed as the two of themsat on the couch and chatted. They had seeneach other that morning so it was more a matterof killing time until the others showed up thananything else.        "Oh by the way,"  Rachel said, "Remindme to give you keys to get in here before youleave. That way you can let yourself in the nexttime you come over. I've got one for Penny tooand I've already given one to Pamela."        "Okay,"  Stephanie answered.        "But be sure to check and make sure thatmy name shows in the peephole plate on thedoor."  Rachel grinned mischievously.  "Cause ifits blank, it means that I've got company and youshould definitely knock first."        Stephanie had to laugh at the warning.Although living at home didn't afford her theprivacy to use such a system, she'd heard about itfrom her cousin who used something like it atcollege.        The laughter was cut short by the sound ofthe intercom buzzer.  Rachel got up and pressedthe speaker button.        "Food delivery."  came the voice from thespeaker which both women recognized as Penny's.        In reply, Rachel reached up and hit thebutton that unlocked the front door.        "Come on up."  she said.                She then went and opened up theapartment door,  waiting for their friends to comeup.        "I wonder why Pamela didn't use her key?"she said.  "I hope she didn't loose it already.        The reason turned out to be even simpler.When Penny got to the top floor, Pamela wasn'twith her.        "I hope someone is going to give me ahand with this,"  the smaller girl called out as sheindicated the three shopping bags she wasburdened down with.  "These aren't exactly light."           Rachel grabbed the largest bag, surprisedby its weight.  It was obvious that it containedmore than take out food.            "Where’s Pamela?"  Rachel asked as sheled the shorter girl into the apartment.           "There was some sort of problem at thestore,"  Penny said as she laid the two bags offood on the kitchen counter.  "She said for me togo along without her.  Said she should be alonglater, but looking at the way everyone wasrunning around the Office Bin, I doubt it."            "So I guess its just the three of us then."Rachel noted as she helped Penny empty the bags."And as usual you’ve brought enough food tofeed a half dozen."           "Well I just like to give everyone a goodvariety,"  Penny laughed.  "Besides, my Uncle wasjust going to have to toss it all if I didn’t take it."            "And some of us can eat like a horse andstill look like a sparrow."  Stephanie said from thecouch with a bit of envy in her voice.           "Oh hi, Stef,"  Penny said as she peeled offher brown leather bomber jacket.  "I didn’t seeyou at first."           "Story of my life."  Stephanie laughed asthey exchanged a brief hug.           True to her sometimes tomboy image,Penny was wearing jeans, sneakers and a shortsleeved corduroy shirt.  Stephanie wished shecould dress for work like that. Penny’s hair lookedlike it was cut even shorter than the last time she’dseen her.  Most woman couldn’t get away withhair like that, but on the short girl it certainlyworked.           "So what’s on the agenda for tonight?"  asked Penny.           "Well I guess some good food, a little wineand whatever’s on the TV."  Rachel replied. "With weather like this I think club hoppings outfor tonight.  So its just us girls."            "Unless you have a guy or two in thosebags."  Stephanie quipped.             Penny made a show of checking the twoempty shopping bags, then looked at her friendswith a disappointing look.            "I knew I forgot something,"  she laughed. "And Willoughby’s was running a special on cuteyoung guys tonight, too."            All three of them laughed at the joke asthey made up plates from the food Penny hadbrought.  Rachel took a cold bottle from therefrigerator and poured them each a glass of wineto go with the dinner.                Conversation over dinner made the mealthat much more enjoyable.  They had just aboutfinished when Stephanie noticed the last ofPenny’s packages still on the floor.             "So what’s with the other bag?" Stephanie asked as she ate.             "Oh I almost forgot,"  Penny replied withexcitement.  "Let me get it."        Dropping the bag on the center of thecountertop, Penny peeled it away to reveal a smallstatuette.  It was a semi-nude woman riding ahorse.  She was clad in battle armor and held asword and shield.  Engraved on the base was thetitle of the piece - Valkerie.         "It’s just a little apartment warming gift." Penny explained.  "When I saw it in the Sci Fi andFantasy shop I just fell in love with it."        "It’s beautiful,"  Rachel exclaimed.  "Iknow just the place for it."        With that, she picked it up and carried itover to the entertainment center.  A moment laterit occupied  a place of honor on it.        "Guess we should see what’s on the tube." Stephanie said, feeling a little bad that she hadn’tbrought a gift too.            "Might as well."  Rachel said as shepicked up the cable remote.  "Bring the wine inwith you."            As the girls settled in, each on their ownsection of the couch, Rachel tossed the remote toPenny who had sat to her right.            "Since you brought such a lovely gift, youget to pick what we watch."  she said.        "All right!"  Penny yelled.  "The ultimatepower -- control of the remote."                It quickly became apparent that even withover 80 channels, there wasn’t a great deal towatch -- at least not tonight.  Penny started withall the prime movie channels, HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, all showing films they had seen before.Next she tried some of the oldies channels, someof those classics were pretty good.  But theystruck out there as well.        "It helps if you stop at a channel for morethan 30 seconds."  Stephanie suggested with asmile.        "Okay rocket scientist, lets see you dobetter."  Penny grinned back as she tossed theremote across the couch.                "The secret,"  Stephanie said as sheclicked on the channel up button.  "Is not torandomly jump around the dial but to start at thebottom and work your way up."        Channel by channel flashed by -- akaleidoscope of entertainment ranging frommovies to game shows, how to shows to cookinghelp.        "This is entertaining,"  Penny said. "Maybewe should try a board game instead or maybe..."        The short black haired girl stopped inmid-sentence, her attention grabbed by the imagethat had just appeared on the large screen.        "Now that’s what I call entertainment!!" Penny cried out, pointing to the screen.        "Omigod, Rachel!"  Stephanie gasped asshe turned from the screen to her friend. "Whatare you doing with the porno channel?"        "Who cares?"  Penny interrupted.  "I likethis."        "Its not what you think,"  Rachel said.  "Ionly ordered basic cable.  Who has the money topay for all those premium channels?"        "And they all just appeared one day onyour TV,"  Stephanie laughed. "Like magic."        "Actually,..."  Stephanie hesitated for amoment.  "When the cable guy hooked this all up,he asked if I wanted all the stations."        "Yeah, right, you just smiled at him and hegave you all this."  Stephanie mocked with asmile.        "All right, he also asked me to dinner." she admitted.        "I bet I know what you had."  Penny laughed as she opened her mouth and slid herhand back and forth in front of it, as if she wereperforming oral sex.        "You know better than that, Penny." Rachel said in a sharp rebuke.        "Oh that’s right, I forgot."  the 20 year oldlied.  "You don’t do things like that."                Truth was, Rachel actually didn’t.  In theeight years of her sexual life, she’d performed oralsex on a guy a total of only two times.  Thesecond had only been to confirm the conclusionshe’d come to after the first:  namely that it wasn’tsomething she ever wanted to do again.         It didn’t make her a prude by any means,she was far from it.  When Rachel finally warmedup to a man enough to want him in her bed, shewas every guys dream: a woman who was warmand supportive in public -- and a wanton whore inthe bedroom.  The only problem was that mostguys didn’t make it to that level with her.  Mostusually lost interest when they learned she didn’tsuck cock.  The cute cable guy had been one ofthem.          "Maybe Rachel doesn’t,"  Stephanie noted,her eyes glued to the television.  "But that girlcertainly does."        The wide 35 inch screen was now filledwith the image of a large breasted blonde whowas giving quite a demonstration in the art offellatio.  The young man’s cock she hadswallowed practically whole was also quiteimpressive.        "She is good at it,"  Penny laughed.  "Maybe you should take notes, Rachel        Rachel made a disapproving face.        "Yeah, like that guys really that big!  I’llbet that’s as fake as that bimbo’s tits."        "Looks pretty real to me."  Penny said.        "Special effects,"  Rachel suggested. "Youcan’t tell me you’ve ever seen a guy that big forreal."        "I have ... "  Stephanie started to saywithout thinking, then caught herself."        It was a momentary slip of the tongue, buteach of the other girls caught it immediately.        "Tell, tell."  they both called out.  "Truthor Dare.  You know the rules."        It was a game they had played amongthemselves, a game of sexual secrets.  If any ofthem admitted to a sexual secret, they had to tellor take a dare.  The dares had sometimes been farworse than the truth.           "Come on Stef,"  Penny encouraged. "Truth or Dare?" she added with wicked emphasison the second choice."         Stephanie considered the possibleconsequences of a dare for a brief moment, thendecided on the truth.        "Robby McPherson."  she answered in alow voice.        "What was that?"  Rachel asked, cuppingher hand around her ear as if she was hard ofhearing.        "Robby McPherson!"  Stephanie repeatedin a louder voice.        "Robby McPherson!"  Penny also repeatedin an even louder voice.        "That computer geek who worked at themall last summer,"  Rachel chimed in. "ThatRobby McPherson?"               "Yes."  Stephanie responded simply.        "What the hell where you thinking?" Rachel asked.        "I can’t believe you dated that loser." Penny added when Stephanie didn’t reply.        "He was not a loser!"  Stephanie snappedback.  "And I didn’t date him ...  I fucked him! There I said it, are you happy." she added, takinga large drink from her wine glass.           "Shit, Stef, that’s even worse."  Rachelsaid.  "Why would you do a thing like that?"        In reply, Stephanie held up both hands andbrought them together until they stopped aboutnine inches apart.  Her meaning was obvious toher friends.  It was a gesture they’d use inreference to guys many times.  The only differencewas that this time it wasn’t a diminutive allusion.        "You’re shitting me."  Rachel said, eyeingthe gap between her hands.        "Honest truth."  Stephanie said, a termnone of them would ever lie about.        "Fuck!"  Rachel exclaimed.  "Who’d haveever thought it."                "Wait a minute,"  Penny cut them off. "Not so fast."        Stephanie and Rachel both turned to theirgirlfriend.        "Look, I’m willing to accept that maybeRobby McPherson, jerk that he might have been,is hung like a horse. And I’ll even admit that giventhe chance, anyone of us would’ve fucked himtoo.  But there is no way that you could’ve knownthat before you hopped into bed with him!"        "Actually, it was the back seat of his Dad’scar."  Stephanie grinned.  "And I did know, mybrother Jerry told me."        Both girls remembered Jerry Morgan hadalso worked at the mall last summer.  In fact, hehad been one of the few people who had beenfriends with Robby.        "How would Jerry know how big he was?" Rachel asked.  "And why would he tell you?"        "The same way I know Judy Peterman hasa large birthmark mole on her ass: the locker roomshowers."  Stephanie said.  "And as to the why, Iasked him once out of idle curiosity who had thebiggest cock in the mall."        "I still don’t buy it,"  Penny said.  "If mybrother asked me which girl in the shower had thebest boobs, I can’t imagine answering him.  And Idefinitely can’t imagine me asking him to checkout cocks for me -- or have him actually do it if Idid."                   "Well, maybe he would,"  Stephanieanswered with a devious smile on her face.  "Ifyou’d gotten him laid."        "You got him laid?"  Penny asked indisbelief.        "Well he thinks I got him laid," Stephanieadmitted.  "Actually all I did was introduce him toGloria Nelson."        "You got him laid," Rachel stated withauthority.  "All you had to do was introduce himto that teencock hungry bitch."                Gloria Nelson was a 37 year-old assistantmanager at the Oakdale Mall.  Twice divorced, itwas no secret among most of the women whoworked there that the redhead had a weakness forbarely legal boys.  Her various sexual escapadeswould have been enough to get her fired, if not forthe fact that her family was one of the mostprominent in town.          Unless one of her conquests turned out tobe underage -- she was always very careful aboutthat -- or one of the young men filed a complaint,even more unlikely after she had freely given themwhat they all would agree was one hot piece ofass -- Gloria would continue with her littleappetites.             "I guess that would be enough to get himto check out some cocks for you."  Penny finallyadmitted.         "To be honest, since that’s the nature ofthe game,"  Stephanie mused,  "I think most guys,Jerry included, do check the others out, to seehow they compare with each other.  They justdon’t want to admit they look at other guys."        "That’s probably true." both girls agreed,remembering secretly checking out classmates inthe showers back when they all started to develop.         "Now can we forget about all this andwatch the movie or something?"  Stephanie asked.            "Okay,"  Penny agreed.  "But I’m still madat you for one thing."        "What’s that?"  Stephanie asked somewhatconfused.        "You knew that twerp had a 9-inch cockand you didn’t tell any of the rest of us!"        All three of them burst into laughter asRachel refilled all their glasses.            For the next three quarters of an hour, thegirls watched the adult film, offering jokes andcomments about what they saw.  Also during thattime they finished off the first bottle of wine andworked their way halfway through a second.Rachel had also thrown a bag of popcorn into themicrowave. After all, what fun was a moviewithout popcorn?         The plot of the movie, such as there wasof one, was that of an adult television station trying to pick its new fall line-up.  A mixture ofmen and women sat in a boardroom, watchingshort clips of various pilots.  It was one such showthat the girls had already watched.  The clips wereshort on plot but long on sex.  As they went on,the members of the selection committee becamemore and more aroused.  A condition each of thegirls could sympathize with, even if they didn’twant to admit it.         The appearance of a small Asian womanon the screen brought immediate comments fromRachel and Stephanie that she resembled Penny, though in fact the multicultrual girl was differenteverywhere beyond Asian features and similarheight.        "I don’t look like that,"  Penny declared inmock protest, adding with a laugh,  "I have muchnicer tits."          It didn’t take long for the Asian actress tobecome involved with her male co-star.  In fact, ittook less than two minutes for these supposedlytotal strangers to get naked and go at it.  As theydid, Penny’s friends continued to remark at howmuch the girl on the screen really looked like her.        "I don’t know Penny,"  Stephanie musedas she watched the actress deep throat the manwho was as generously endowed as the actor inthe first clip.  "We’ve double dated and I have tosay, that sure looks like you."         "Yeah, are you sure you haven’t beenmoonlighting?"  Rachel chimed in.        "Why?"  Penny laughed.  "Are youjealous?"        Their friendly barbs continued as theon-screen couple continued their endeavors.  Theman climbed behind the girl and positioned hiscock against her ass.  With a loud grunt, hepushed his manhood inside her, accompanied bysqueals of encouragement from his partner.        "Ouch!"  Stephanie cried.  "That’s got tohurt!"        "Well, that proves that’s not me."  Pennygrimaced.  ‘This little ass is much too tight forsomething that big."  she quipped as she pattedher bottom.        "I don’t know,"  Rachel mused.  "I’veheard that if it’s done right it can be quite fun. After all, isn’t that what gay guys do?  There hasto be something pleasurable about it."        "Well when you find out, you can let therest of us know."  Stephanie retorted, wonderingif perhaps her friend had already tried it and didn’twant to admit it.                Another scene change brought an olderwoman in her forties to the screen, already ridingatop a young man who couldn’t be far out of histeens.  Almost immediately all three of them calledout the name of Gloria Nelson.  The fact that thiswoman was a brunette instead of a redheadmattered little.          "I guess that makes that your brother Jerrylaying underneath her."  Penny offered.        "No way,"  Stephanie retorted.  "Mybrother has a much better bod."        As one, Penny and Rachel snapped theirheads around to look in astonishment.        "Oh come on, you both have brothers." Stephanie added tartly. "You can’t tell me thatsomewhere along the line you haven’t gotten apeek at them, just like I’m sure they’ve gotten apeek at you."        Silence gave truth to her assertion.  It wasobvious that the wine, and the movie, were muchresponsible for her frankness.           Back on the screen, the Gloria Nelsonsurrogate was riding the younger man like a rodeorider atop a bull.  Her large unrestrained breastsbouncing in all directions.  The look of ecstasy onher face was a powerful enticement to the joys ofteenage boys.                "What do you think will happen first?" Penny asked.  "He pops his cork or that bedcollapses beneath them?"            "I’d say 50 - 50 either way."  Rachelanswered.        "I’ll go with his popping his cork," Stephanie bet. "That bed is stronger than it looks."        Less than an minute later, Stephanie wonthe bet as "Gloria" suddenly jumped off the youngman and spun around on the bed, her hand neverreleasing it’s grip on his hard cock.  Soon as thebrunette’s face reached his boyhood, it explodedin a shower of hot whiteness, covering her eagerlips and cheeks with his eruption.                The preview faded from view, to bereplaced by another scene.  It looked like thelocker room of the local high school.  From offcamera, the sound of running water could beheard from the showers.        "Anyone care to guess what kind of scenethis one is going to be?"  Penny asked, turning themovie into a sort of guessing game.        "My guess is the Quarterback andCheerleader."  Rachel said as she tossed half ahandful of popcorn into her mouth.        "Teacher and Student’s my guess." Stephanie said.        "I’m going to go with a gang bang." Penny offered with a wicked grin.        The Asian girl won that round as the starof the little epic, a tall statuesque blonde dressedin a very tight white uniform came into the lockerroom.  Evidently she was supposed to be theschool nurse.  She acted surprised when the soundof running water ceased and a half dozen nakedhunks walked into view.          In no time at all, the busty blonde waslaying on one of the benches, a stiff member ineach of her hands, a hard one in her mouth, afourth and fifth in her shaved pussy and tight ass. Standing just off to the right of the after-schoolorgy was the best looking of all the guys, playfullystroking the largest cock of the group and waitingfor an opening he could put it into.            "Guess she never heard of the idea thatyou can have too much of a good thing."  Rachelcommented.        "Maybe,"  Penny said.  "But I’d be glad totake care of the odd man out there."        "Get in line girl."  Stephanie cut in.                For so energetic a scene, it turned out tobe surprisingly short.  The odd man out never didfind his hole, but joined in with his buddies ingiving the nurse a cum shower.        "Well, so much for the idea that more isbetter."  Rachel said.        "Yeah, I think I prefer my sex one onone,"  Stephanie added.        "Me too,"  Penny chimed in.  "Well, maybetwo on one, but no more than that.  Except maybeon special occasions of course."                Rachel and Stephanie both laughed, notsure how much of Penny’s statement was intendedas a joke.         The scene shifted back to the boardroomwere several of the network executives were nowin various stages of undress, already engaged in sexual acts.  One of the female executives, a darkhaired thirty year old, was spread across the table,her dress up around her waist, her legs spreadwide.  Buried between those legs was the face of amale executive.  Kneeing beside that man was oneof the secretaries, her own mouth wrapped tightlyaround the cock sticking out from his threehundred dollar suit.          At the head of the table, the silver-grayhaired chairman of the board was also missing thelower half of his high priced suit, his own cockhowever was not as visible.  Instead it was buriedin the red-haired mound of the second secretarywho was being mounted doggie style by the seniorexecutive.          At the head of the room, the narrator ofthe film, who had also introducing the TV pilots,was trying to ignore the spectacle before him. Hecontinued to tell about the last show on theagenda.  It began to run on the monitor as thenarrator threw up his hand in surrender and pulledout his cock, sliding it into the mouth of theredhead.         The boardroom image faded, replaced bythe kitchen of a small apartment.  Standing at thecounter, her back to the camera, was a youngHispanic woman in her twenties.  Wearing a pairof cut off shorts and a red and white striped tanktop, she was pouring herself a cup of coffee.  Asshe turned to face the camera, a second cup became visible on the counter.  A smile crossed herlips as she tasted the steaming liquid.        Another figure then entered the kitchen, alight skinned brunette wearing a blue bathrobe.Her tousled short hair gave added evidence thatshe had just gotten out of bed. Pushing a lock ofloose hair away from her eyes, she accepted thesecond cup of coffee. In a brief chat the newarrival's name was revealed as Donna and thecoffee maker's as Modesta.         In no time at all, Donna’s robe fell opened,revealing a soft body accented by small curvingmounds, the pink nipples of which were both hardand visible.  The cup at her lips was quicklyreplaced by the equally hot lips of her companion.         With dazzling speed, the darker skinnedgirl traced a wet path down from the brunettes lipsto her breast. The nipple of which quicklydisappeared between her lips.         "Oh my!"  Stephanie gasped as shewatched the onscreen encounter advance to thenext stage.  She had crossed the room to pick upsome more muchies, but had stopped in mid stepat the sight.          In no time at all, Modesta's attentiondropped below her companion’s waist.  Stephaniehad seen women kiss each other on a few daringtelevision shows, had even seen them caress eachother’s breasts in an R rated film, but never hadshe seen a woman performing oral sex on anotherwoman.        The camera zoomed in, giving a close upview of Modesta’s tongue darting up and into thepink recesses of Donna’s pussy.  The picture wasso vivid that Stephanie could see the shiny layer ofnectar Modesta’s ministrations had produced.        ‘God, could you ever imagine doingsomething like that?"  Stephanie asked, her eyesnever leaving the screen.                It took a few long seconds for her torealize her friends hadn’t answered -- which shefound unusual.  She couldn’t ever remember thembeing at a loss for words!        "Could you ever imagine doing anythinglike that?"  she repeated, assuming they hadn’theard her.                The continued silence finally broke herfixation on the screen.  She turned her attentionback to Rachel.  The look on her girlfriend’s facewas akin to that of a kid who’d been caught witha hand in the cookie jar.                       "You’re kidding!"  Stephanie declared.        "Well, if you can be honest about RobbyMcPherson, then I should be honest too."  Rachel admitted.        "I don’t believe it,"  Stephanie said.  "Ithink now you’re putting me on.  Who have youever done it with?"                Rachel took a moment to think about heranswer.  Stephanie expected Rachel to say somedistant friend, if anything.  Instead the brunettelooked past the blond to the other end of the     couch.        Stephanie followed her line of sight, untilit stopped on an equally guilty face.        "Oh no, you had me going for a moment," Stephanie said, a touch of amusement in her tone."But now you’re stretching this a bit too far  --just a little bit over the top.  That was almost asgood as that story you had me believing aboutTracy Conway last month.                Tracy Conway was a somewhat masculinewoman in her thirties who also worked in the Mallat a sporting goods store.  One night, following afew hours of bar-hopping, the other girls hadconvinced Stephanie that Tracy was female as theresult of  a sex change operation.  It tookStephanie a week to discover it had been a joke.          Stephanie looked again at both of herfriends.  Neither one of them were laughing thistime.  Instead they shared a silent communication.        Without a word Penny got up from thecouch and walked past Stephanie. When shereached Rachel, the young Asian woman reachedup and gently stroked her cheek.  Then she pulledthe taller woman down to her level and kissed heron the lips.          It was a soft kiss at first, the kind that onefriend might give another, no different than someStephanie herself had gotten.  Then it becamemore and more erotic, a melding of lips and eagertongues.  Rachel responded in turn, pressing hardagainst the younger girl.        Stephanie was still trying to decide if thiswas a gag when Penny pushed the game evenfurther.  She slipped her hand up under Rachel’sT-shirt and fondled the naked flesh beneath it.         Breaking the kiss, she pulled up the thinmaterial and planted kisses on Rachel’s nowexposed breasts as well. Mimicking Modesta’sactions on the cable station, Penny slid her tongueunder Rachel’s erect nipple and guided it into hermouth.               "Shit,"  Stephanie finally exclaimed in arush of air. "This isn’t a joke."        With that, the two lovers ended theirembrace and faced their friend.  Their faces nowreflected a look of expectation.                Glancing back at the TV image, Stephanienoted that the two woman were now locked in a69 position, their mouths pressed tightly in eachother’s wet mounds.  What truly startled her wasthat, in her mind, instead of Donna and Modesta,the forms she now saw pressed together werethose of Rachel and Penny.                "Is it really as much fun as it looks?"  shewondered out loud.        In reply, she felt a soft hand come to reston her shoulder.           "We’d be happy to show you if you’rereally interested."  Rachel said.  "The only reasonwe never asked before is we weren’t sure of howyou’d react."        "Then why did you tell me now?" Stephanie asked.        "Honestly, I’m not sure,"  Stephanielaughed softly, trying to break the underlyingtension. "I didn’t plan it this way, it just seemedthe perfect time."        Stephanie thought about it for a briefmoment and decided that events had indeed madethis the perfect time.  The wine, the conversationthey’d been having had put them all at ease withwhat would normally have been a very awkwardsubject.        "And if  I thought that this wasn’t the sortof thing for me?"  Stephanie asked.        "Then I hope we’d just forget it all andstill be the same friends we all were 10 minutesago." Rachel replied.              Stephanie again looked past Rachel toPenny.  The younger girl hadn’t said a single wordsince Stephanie’s revelation.  She didn’t have to.The look in her eyes and on her face was amixture of apprehension and lust.        "Well I’ve always said,"  Stephanie said,placing her hand atop Rachel’s.  "You should tryeverything in life -- at least once."          She shifted her body ever so slightly, justenough to bring herself face to face with Rachel. Leaning forward, she pressed her lips against her.                It wasn’t the first time she had ever kissedRachel.  There had been many occasions when shekissed other girls, but never like this.  The touchof their lips now seemed electric.  A warmthspread throughout their bodies from that briefcontact.  The kiss was at the same time both briefand endless.          Still unsure of the situation, Rachel letStephanie take the lead.  It wasn’t until the blondkissed her a second time that Rachel began torespond.        Stephanie closed her eyes and the passionbuilding within her take control. She pushed hertongue into Rachel’s mouth, exploring thesoftness of it’s mirror image.        Rachel took hold of Stephanie’s hands andpressed them against her breasts. Tentatively, sheexplored the material covered mounds.  It was thefirst time she had ever felt the softness of aanother woman’s breast, the hardness of erectnipples.        As Stephanie continued to explore herfriends body, Rachel slid her own hands up anddown her friend’s back.  She took hold of thezipper of her dress and pulled it down, exposingthe flesh beneath it.  She caressed that flesh,running her nails across it.                The touch of a new hand caused Stephanieto open her eyes.  Penny now stood next to her aswell, a wide smile on her face.  Stephanie shiftedher attention to the youngest of her friends andkissed her too.  A kiss equal in intensity to thatshe had just given Rachel.  To Stephanie’s delight,the reaction she felt to it was also the same.        The three young women stood interlockedin the center of the room, kissing, exploring eachothers bodies, loosening clothing and searchingout the flesh beneath it.        "Maybe we should all just take a minuteand get comfortable."  Rachel suggestion.         The other’s nodded their agreement, andthey all took a few steps back from each other. Rachel was wearing the least so it took her only afew seconds to drop her shirt and panties to thefloor.  Standing naked in the center of the roomfor the second time that night, she took a momentto shut off the television. There was no longer anyneed for it, not when a much more interestingentertainment was about to commence.        Penny and Stephanie took only a littlelonger.  A small pile of clothes rested at eachgirl’s feet, topped by undergarments of variousdesigns.  Now they all stood naked, looking ateach other during an awkward pause.        Only a short time before, Stephanie hadfelt a little strange looking at Rachel’s nakedbody. Now she looked with a different eye.  All ofthem took a moment to look at each other.         Stephanie was surprised to see that Pennyhad shaved the hair between her legs.  She knewfrom brief glimpses that there never had beenmuch there to begin with.  But the absence of thatlittle bit made the small girl seem even more like ateenager. Rachel on the other hand, had a widepatch of dark brown hair.  Stephanie’s own bushwas somewhere between the two extremes and alight blond.        Even their breasts formed a sharp contrast, not just in size, ranging from Rachel’s 38C toPenny’s 34B, but in the very shape of them. Stephanie’s were very rounded with wide pinkcircles around short pink nipples.  Rachel’smounds were conical in nature with puffy areolasthat stuck out even further.  Penny had the darkestnipples of the three, a rich dark brown againstbutternut skin.                  "So now what?"  Stephanie asked as shetossed her hands up in the air.        "Why don’t you make yourselfcomfortable on the couch," Rachel suggested witha smile.  "and let us take care of getting thingsstarted."        Thinking it not a bad suggestion at all,Stephanie sat down on the center of the widecouch.  Rachel and Penny sat down beside her,tossing the larger throw pillows onto thehardwood floor.  They would come in handy later.        Penny kissed Stephanie.  Then Rachelkissed Stephanie.  Then, leaning across the middlegirl, Penny kissed Rachel.  As they did, they eachcupped the closest of Stephanie’s breasts, playingtheir fingers across her nipples - enjoying thestiffness found there.        Stephanie couldn’t help but compare thetouch of the two women to that of men she’dknown.  For the most part, it was softer -- yet atthe same time much more erotic.  As were the sensations it produced.  Even more pleasing werethe waves of delight that filled her breasts whenthose skillful fingers where replaced with evenmore talented mouths.         Matching tongues traced a path acrosssupple flesh, until they met in the rich valleybetween the mounds.  There the two lovers kissedonce more before parting in different directions.         Penny continued to kiss and caressStephanie’s breasts, alternating between softtouches and gentle bites.  Working her way backto Stephanie’s willing mouth, she pressed herdarker breasts hard against the those of the girlbeneath her. The nipple to nipple contact wasenough to elicit a soft moan from Stephanie.  Amoan cut short by the crush of Penny’s mouth.        Rachel had moved her attentions lower,dropping down to sit on one of the oversizedcushions.  With a hand on each of Stef’s thighs,she spread them apart to expose the blond-framedpearl.        Burying her head between the pale legs,Rachel ran her tongue along the length of herfriend’s womanhood -- her heart racing withexcitement at the idea that she was the firstwoman ever to do so.  The scent of Stephanie’salready damp mound was intoxicating, a feastwaiting to be savored.         Not to be denied, she drove her tongue upbetween the folds of those sugar walls, clearing apath to the clitoris.  A path quickly followed.        "Oh God!!"  Stephanie gasped as she feltRachel’s tongue strike her like the spark to amatch.  It was enough for her to momentaryforget the girl still playing with both her breastsand mouth.          But only for a moment as Penny liftedherself higher and guided one of her own richmounds to Stephanie’s lips.  Her mouth still openfrom her gasp, Penny pushed her erect nipplebetween the blonde’s red lips.        There had often been times whenStephanie had often wondered what it might feellike to suck on a woman’s breasts.  Her ownmounds were too small to try it on herself.  She’dincluded sucking on a man’s nipples as part of herloveplay, but she was sure it wasn’t the same.        Now with the reality between her teeth,she knew that her earlier conclusion was right. Playing with a man’s nipples was nothing like thereal thing of a woman.  She could taste Penny in away that she never could a man, delighting in themixture of soft and hard.  She ran her tongue backand forth across the dark, pert tips, trying torepeat the pleasing affect that Penny had producedin her.           As the now saturated nipple slipped fromher lips, Penny wrapped her hands around theback of Stephanie’s head, guiding her face to thesoft spot between her breasts, inviting her to feastthere as well, an invitation Stephanie was all toowilling to accept.  She licked her way across thedamp skin, enjoying the heady aroma filling hernostrils. Then with girlish delight she repeated herperformance on Penny’s other mound.        Her interest still fixed on Stephanie’spussy, Rachel slid one finger, then another deepwithin it.  The initial wetness she found there increased as she moved her fingers back and forth. With their motion waves of enchantmentexpanded to fill Stephanie’s relaxed form.        Rachel augmented the touch of her fingerswith that of her tongue, reaching her friend’s mostsensitive spots as if they were familiar as her own. In truth many of them were identical.          If Stephanie had time to think about it --which her two friends were definitely not allowing-- she might have appreciated the irony of thesituation.  Rachel, who cringed at the thought oftaking a man in her mouth, had no such hesitationwhere another woman was involved.        "This feels so fucking good!"  Stephaniemoaned as she laid back and enjoyed thetwo-pronged assault on her body.  "I don’t thinkI’ve ever felt this fantastic."         As Penny climbed off Stephanie, Rachelalso moved back.  Together they guided theirneophyte lover onto the large pillows they hadearlier tossed to the floor.  As soon as Stephanielaid across the pillows, Rachel again spread herlegs and went right back to where she left off.        Penny had other ideas.  It was timeStephanie learned how to give as well as receive.Squatting over Stephanie’s face, Penny droppeddown until her pussy was only a few inches aboveit.        Prior to this moment, Stephanie had neverseen another woman’s sex close up.  The fact thatPenny’s was totally hairless gave it an even moreinteresting perspective.  The first thing she noticedwas that for such a small girl, Penny had anunusually large clitoris. It was almost like a tinypenis.         No imagination was needed for Stephanieto figure out what Penny wanted. Unlike Rachel,Stephanie never had a problem with oral sex, sowith virginal enthusiasm, she reached out with hertongue and ran it across Penny’s erect clit.        "Oh yeah baby,"  Penny panted.  "Go forit!"        Go for it Stephanie did, pulling Penny’sclit between her lips, massaging it with hertongue.  Then she swept it back across the lengthof Penny’s pussy, savoring her first taste of awoman.          The scent of Penny's sex was almostoverpowering, and to her delight she learned withher first lick that the taste was all she hoped itwould be.  Penny lowered her pelvis further sothat Stephanie could have easier access to her wetcunt.          Slowly at first, Stephanie licked theyounger girl, exploring her womanhood.  Thenshe began to quicken the pace until she reached arhythm that sent little ripples throughout Penny'sbody.          Ripples that mirrored those fillingStephanie's body as Rachel continued to workmagic between her legs.  As one hand continuedto slide outstretched fingers up and down theblond framed love canal, the brunette’s other handworked the same enchantment on her own -- withmuch the same results.        Faster and faster all three of them went,plunging down the well of ecstasy.  It was a raceto rapture - a pursuit each wanted to win.          To her surprise, Stephanie produced thefirst orgasm as Penny’s body suddenly convulsedagainst her mouth and it filled with a blast ofhoney.  It was such a sexual rush that it sentStephanie’s own body over the edge, showering Rachel with the same gift.  A reward she hungrilyaccepted.        Finally, Rachel joined the chorus, meremoments behind the others, propelled by thesymphony of her fingers                  "Oh my god!"  Stephanie exclaimed asthey laid naked on the floor, still entwined in eachother’s bodies.  "I can’t believe how intense thatwas.  How did you ever get the idea to trysomething like this ... and how long have you beendoing it?"                "Well it was originally Penny’s idea." Rachel replied, running her hand alongsidePenny’s cheek.  "And we’ve been doing it, as youcall it, for the last six months."        Stephanie turned to Penny, but before shecould ask the question on her lips, Pennyanswered it with a laugh.        "I’ve been doing it since I was 16. Whatcan I say?  I’ve always been an advanced learner."                 The other two girls joined in the laughteras they continued to stroke and kiss each other. They all knew what had just happened was onlythe beginning.  There would be many more littleadventures in their collective future.                "Err ... Rachel,"  Stephanie suddenly askedseriously.  "Remember what you said earliertonight about the nameplate on the door?"        "Of course,"  Rachel answered, wonderingwhy Stephanie was suddenly concerned aboutsomething so mundane.        "I think you might want to try andremember that a little harder in the future." Stephanie continued.                "Oh shit!" Penny cried out abruptly, cutting off any further inquiry Rachel might havehad about Stephanie’s sudden tangent.                Rachel followed Penny’s gaze until allthree of them were looking at the front doorway. An entrance now filled by the tall figure of a darkskinned young woman in a bright red raincoat,holding a silver keychain in her hand.                "Fuck!"  Rachel blurted out," "Pamela!"        They all sat silent after that for longseconds,  like statues in some far off garden.                "Looks like I missed one hell of a party." Pamela said as she pulled off her raincoat anddraped it over a wall hook, revealing a bluebusiness suit.  "And here I thought I knew whatkind of people my friends were." she said in a hurttone.                 "Oh fuck!"  Rachel repeated.  The othertwo girls were still too stunned to say anythingelse.                "I am disappointed in you all,"  Pameladeclared as she stepped into the room and stoodover the naked trio.  "I thought we were supposedto be the Four Musketeers!"                It took a few seconds for them to realizethat the oldest of their little group wasn’t reallyangry or shocked at all. In fact, it was nowbecoming obvious that she hadn’t just walked ineither. How long she’d been watching was anquestion unasked -- at least for now.          With smiles now filling their faces, allthree girls reached up and pulled Pamela downinto the center of their circle.  She seemed a littleout of place with her conservative attire, butwithin a few minutes that was gone as well.  Herdark form was soon covered by an intermix oflighter hues.                Hours later, long after the rain hadstopped and the night once more grew quiet, thesounds of passion could still be heard.  Thequartet truly learned the meaning of their motto. One for all, and all for one.    END #*#One For AllOne For All ...by Ann Douglas#*#        Stepping into the building vestibule,Stephanie Morgan shook the water from herumbrella. It had only been a little over two blockwalk from the bus stop, but she had gotten soakednevertheless. Opening her raincoat, the 24 yearold blond made an attempt to shake that dry aswell.        It had been bad luck that her brotherJerry’s car had picked tonight of all nights not tostart up.  He had promised to drop her off at herfriend Rachel’s new apartment. No matter, shereluctantly concluded, at least she was here now.        "Lets see,"  she mused as she ran herfinger across the row of intercom buttons."Alexander ... Markham ... Ford ...  here it is,Lieberman, 5B"        It took a few moments to get a response,then a semi-distorted voice filtered through thespeaker.        "Hello?"  the female voice asked.        "Rachel, it’s me Stef."  she replied.        "Come on up," Rachel said as the buzzersounded and the inner door unlocked.  "I’m in theshower."          "She’s in the shower?"  Stephanie laughedas she glanced back out into the rain coveredstreet.         As she walked up the stairs to the fifthfloor apartment, Stephanie couldn’t help but envyher girlfriends new accommodations.  To someonestill living at home, the small apartment complexmight has well been a palace. There was no waythe salesgirl could afford a place like this on hersalary.          Of course Rachel really couldn’t afford aplace like this on her salary either.  The buildingwas owned by Martin Lieberman, who whenasked by his widowed sister-in-law to help herdaughter find an apartment was more than happyto find her this one.  It was a small thing to makea woman he’d admired for years happy.  Besides,having his niece living here assured him a honestpair of eyes to watch over his investment.         Reaching the fifth floor of the smallapartment building, Stephanie found that therewere some limits to Mr. Lieberman's generosityafter all.  Apartment 5B was a small studioapartment, one of three on the top floor.  Tryingthe door, she found it unlocked and steppedinside.        "Rachel," the blue eyed blond called out asshe closed the door behind her.        "I'm in here, Stef," came a reply from the bathroom, a voice much more recognizable thanthe one that had come over the intercom.  "Makeyourself comfortable and  I'll be out in a fewminutes."            Hanging her coat, on the rack by the door,Stephanie checked the short red dress she waswearing.  It was a little damp but otherwise okay.She had gotten home late and didn’t have time tochange clothes.          As she waited, Stephanie took in hersurroundings.  The apartment might be small, butit had a certain charm.  The first feature shenoticed were large twin skylights in the ceiling. The soft patter of rain could be heard againstthem.  On a clear day or night, they would give anice natural light to the room.        On the far left, a large bay window alsoadded to the natural light.  The view beyond itwas nothing special, but it was a nice feature.  A kitchenette over by the bathroom entranceconsisted of a small refrigerator, a stovetop and microwave. And of course a kitchen sink.        There really wasn't much in the way ofdecoration on the walls, but then Rachel had onlybeen living there a few weeks.  The center of theroom was dominated by a large green oversizedU-shaped sofa.  In addition to the deep cushions,it was covered with equally push and oversizedpillows.  Rachel had mentioned to her that sheused the sofa in place of a bed.        At the open end of the couch was one ofthose small self assembly entertainment centers, the bottom of  which was filled with her friend'sold stereo system . What was new was the large35-inch color television, a housewarming gift fromRachel's grandmother.  The couch had been onefrom her mother.        On both sides of the television were someframed photographs.  One brought a smile toStephanie’s face. The 5 x 7 picture was veryfamiliar to the 24 year old.  A smaller version wasstuck in the mirror frame in her own bedroom. The picture had been taken last summer at theOakdale Mall Talent Show.        Centered in the picture was Rachel ofcourse.  She always had to be the center ofattention.  To her right was Stephanie herself.That was when her hair had been down toher shoulders, rather than the short curly look shenow wore.        To Rachel's left was a much smaller girl,whose mixed Philippine, Chinese and Spanishheritage had given her a soft brown complexion. Her very short black hair and unisex featuresgave her an androgynous look.  In fact, if it wasn'tfor the small mounds protruding from her chest,she might've been mistaken for a teenage boy. Her name was Annie Liu, but everyone called herPenny.  Despite her teenage looks, she was 20years old.        The last member of the quartet was a tallblack woman standing just behind and to theleft of Rachel. Five foot ten, she stood half a headtaller than any of the others, more than that inthe case of Penny's five two. Her skin was ebonyblack, a sharp contrast to both Rachel andStephanie.  Most men first noticed her somewhatample bust.  In the case of women it was her jetblack hair which she usually wore in an elaboratedesign.  At 26, Pamela Wilson was the oldestmember of their little band.        All four women worked at the OakdaleMall. Rachel was a medical assistant.  Stephaniewas a sales representative at one of the large department stores.  Penny worked at her unclesrestaurant. She was also a college student. Pamela was the associate manager of  an officesupply store.        Despite their differences in ages andbackgrounds, they had all become friends overcountless shared lunches.  Soon their friendshipshad extended beyond work.  The picture hadcaptured one of the highlights of that friendship. Billing themselves as the Four Musketeers, sonamed because those were the only costumes theycould find, they had entered the talent showas a singing group.  It was more fun than hardwork and the money went to charity.  To theirsurprise, they finished in second place.  Since thenthey still jokingly referred to themselves as theFour Musketeers.        "We'd have gotten first,"  Stephaniethought as she replaced the picture on theentertainment center. "If we paraded around halfnaked like Judy Peterman.  The judges weremore impressed by her big nipples stickingthrough her blouse than her singing."        "Any sign of the rain letting up?"  Rachelasked as she walked out of the bathroom.        "No, it looks like tonight’s a totalwashout."  Stephanie replied as she turned aroundat the sound of her voice.        "A pity."  Rachel commented as shewalked over to Stephanie and kissed her on thecheek as a friendly hello.        Covered only by a large bath towel thatshe had wrapped around herself, Rachel walkedover to a large dresser that lined the far wall, stilldrying her hair as she walked.        "It really sucks that it had to rain tonight" Rachel said , pulling a pair of panties and anoversized T-shirt from the top drawer.  "I waslooking forward to that concert."        The original plan for the evening was for agirls night out.  One of their favorite local bandswas holding an open air concert in Marshall Park.They'd planned to take dinner a couple of blanketsand a few bottles of wine out to enjoy the music. Unfortunately Mother Nature had other ideas.  Sorather than let the night go to waste, they haddecided to have a girl's night in instead.        "Penny and Pamela are picking up thefood." Rachel said as she unwrapped the towelfrom around her and let it fall to the floor.  "I'mnot sure what they're getting, but knowing Pamelait's sure to be something interesting." she added asshe stood there nude as the day she was born.        "I guess so." Stephanie replied in anstrained tone.        Silly as she knew it was, Stephanie felt it alittle strange for her friend to be standing nude infront of her as they continued their conversation. It wasn't of course the first time she'd seen Rachelnaked.  They'd gone to the beach many times, aswell as clothes shopping both together and as partof the group.  They'd shared dressing rooms manytimes, but somehow it now seemed different --somewhat out of context maybe, standing nakedin the living room.  Then she reminded herself thatthis was also Rachel's bedroom, a place where itwas perfectly natural for her to be nude.        Stephanie also considered that she feltuncomfortable because when they'd first met,Rachel and she had almost the same physicalbuild, the main difference being Rachel's darkerbrown hair and slightly larger breasts.  Thatdifference had grown to more than a few poundsof extra weight on Stephanie. Despite assurancesfrom many of her friends that she looked betterwith the extra weight, which was still within thenorm for her size, she always felt self-consciousabout it. It was an outgrowth of her teen yearswhen she had actually been overweight.        It didn't take Rachel long to put on thepair of panties and the T-shirt she had taken out.Since she was home and not planning to go out,she didn't see the need for anything more.  Withher breasts still a little damp, Rachel's much darkernipples clearly showed through the thin cotton.        "Judy Peterman would’ve been  proud." Stephanie thought with a laugh as her discomfortpassed.        Fifteen minutes passed as the two of themsat on the couch and chatted. They had seeneach other that morning so it was more a matterof killing time until the others showed up thananything else.        "Oh by the way,"  Rachel said, "Remindme to give you keys to get in here before youleave. That way you can let yourself in the nexttime you come over. I've got one for Penny tooand I've already given one to Pamela."        "Okay,"  Stephanie answered.        "But be sure to check and make sure thatmy name shows in the peephole plate on thedoor."  Rachel grinned mischievously.  "Cause ifits blank, it means that I've got company and youshould definitely knock first."        Stephanie had to laugh at the warning.Although living at home didn't afford her theprivacy to use such a system, she'd heard about itfrom her cousin who used something like it atcollege.        The laughter was cut short by the sound ofthe intercom buzzer.  Rachel got up and pressedthe speaker button.        "Food delivery."  came the voice from thespeaker which both women recognized as Penny's.        In reply, Rachel reached up and hit thebutton that unlocked the front door.        "Come on up."  she said.                She then went and opened up theapartment door,  waiting for their friends to comeup.        "I wonder why Pamela didn't use her key?"she said.  "I hope she didn't loose it already.        The reason turned out to be even simpler.When Penny got to the top floor, Pamela wasn'twith her.        "I hope someone is going to give me ahand with this,"  the smaller girl called out as sheindicated the three shopping bags she wasburdened down with.  "These aren't exactly light."           Rachel grabbed the largest bag, surprisedby its weight.  It was obvious that it containedmore than take out food.            "Where’s Pamela?"  Rachel asked as sheled the shorter girl into the apartment.           "There was some sort of problem at thestore,"  Penny said as she laid the two bags offood on the kitchen counter.  "She said for me togo along without her.  Said she should be alonglater, but looking at the way everyone wasrunning around the Office Bin, I doubt it."            "So I guess its just the three of us then."Rachel noted as she helped Penny empty the bags."And as usual you’ve brought enough food tofeed a half dozen."           "Well I just like to give everyone a goodvariety,"  Penny laughed.  "Besides, my Uncle wasjust going to have to toss it all if I didn’t take it."            "And some of us can eat like a horse andstill look like a sparrow."  Stephanie said from thecouch with a bit of envy in her voice.           "Oh hi, Stef,"  Penny said as she peeled offher brown leather bomber jacket.  "I didn’t seeyou at first."           "Story of my life."  Stephanie laughed asthey exchanged a brief hug.           True to her sometimes tomboy image,Penny was wearing jeans, sneakers and a shortsleeved corduroy shirt.  Stephanie wished shecould dress for work like that. Penny’s hair lookedlike it was cut even shorter than the last time she’dseen her.  Most woman couldn’t get away withhair like that, but on the short girl it certainlyworked.           "So what’s on the agenda for tonight?"  asked Penny.           "Well I guess some good food, a little wineand whatever’s on the TV."  Rachel replied. "With weather like this I think club hoppings outfor tonight.  So its just us girls."            "Unless you have a guy or two in thosebags."  Stephanie quipped.             Penny made a show of checking the twoempty shopping bags, then looked at her friendswith a disappointing look.            "I knew I forgot something,"  she laughed. "And Willoughby’s was running a special on cuteyoung guys tonight, too."            All three of them laughed at the joke asthey made up plates from the food Penny hadbrought.  Rachel took a cold bottle from therefrigerator and poured them each a glass of wineto go with the dinner.                Conversation over dinner made the mealthat much more enjoyable.  They had just aboutfinished when Stephanie noticed the last ofPenny’s packages still on the floor.             "So what’s with the other bag?" Stephanie asked as she ate.             "Oh I almost forgot,"  Penny replied withexcitement.  "Let me get it."        Dropping the bag on the center of thecountertop, Penny peeled it away to reveal a smallstatuette.  It was a semi-nude woman riding ahorse.  She was clad in battle armor and held asword and shield.  Engraved on the base was thetitle of the piece - Valkerie.         "It’s just a little apartment warming gift." Penny explained.  "When I saw it in the Sci Fi andFantasy shop I just fell in love with it."        "It’s beautiful,"  Rachel exclaimed.  "Iknow just the place for it."        With that, she picked it up and carried itover to the entertainment center.  A moment laterit occupied  a place of honor on it.        "Guess we should see what’s on the tube." Stephanie said, feeling a little bad that she hadn’tbrought a gift too.            "Might as well."  Rachel said as shepicked up the cable remote.  "Bring the wine inwith you."            As the girls settled in, each on their ownsection of the couch, Rachel tossed the remote toPenny who had sat to her right.            "Since you brought such a lovely gift, youget to pick what we watch."  she said.        "All right!"  Penny yelled.  "The ultimatepower -- control of the remote."                It quickly became apparent that even withover 80 channels, there wasn’t a great deal towatch -- at least not tonight.  Penny started withall the prime movie channels, HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, all showing films they had seen before.Next she tried some of the oldies channels, someof those classics were pretty good.  But theystruck out there as well.        "It helps if you stop at a channel for morethan 30 seconds."  Stephanie suggested with asmile.        "Okay rocket scientist, lets see you dobetter."  Penny grinned back as she tossed theremote across the couch.                "The secret,"  Stephanie said as sheclicked on the channel up button.  "Is not torandomly jump around the dial but to start at thebottom and work your way up."        Channel by channel flashed by -- akaleidoscope of entertainment ranging frommovies to game shows, how to shows to cookinghelp.        "This is entertaining,"  Penny said. "Maybewe should try a board game instead or maybe..."        The short black haired girl stopped inmid-sentence, her attention grabbed by the imagethat had just appeared on the large screen.        "Now that’s what I call entertainment!!" Penny cried out, pointing to the screen.        "Omigod, Rachel!"  Stephanie gasped asshe turned from the screen to her friend. "Whatare you doing with the porno channel?"        "Who cares?"  Penny interrupted.  "I likethis."        "Its not what you think,"  Rachel said.  "Ionly ordered basic cable.  Who has the money topay for all those premium channels?"        "And they all just appeared one day onyour TV,"  Stephanie laughed. "Like magic."        "Actually,..."  Stephanie hesitated for amoment.  "When the cable guy hooked this all up,he asked if I wanted all the stations."        "Yeah, right, you just smiled at him and hegave you all this."  Stephanie mocked with asmile.        "All right, he also asked me to dinner." she admitted.        "I bet I know what you had."  Penny laughed as she opened her mouth and slid herhand back and forth in front of it, as if she wereperforming oral sex.        "You know better than that, Penny." Rachel said in a sharp rebuke.        "Oh that’s right, I forgot."  the 20 year oldlied.  "You don’t do things like that."                Truth was, Rachel actually didn’t.  In theeight years of her sexual life, she’d performed oralsex on a guy a total of only two times.  Thesecond had only been to confirm the conclusionshe’d come to after the first:  namely that it wasn’tsomething she ever wanted to do again.         It didn’t make her a prude by any means,she was far from it.  When Rachel finally warmedup to a man enough to want him in her bed, shewas every guys dream: a woman who was warmand supportive in public -- and a wanton whore inthe bedroom.  The only problem was that mostguys didn’t make it to that level with her.  Mostusually lost interest when they learned she didn’tsuck cock.  The cute cable guy had been one ofthem.          "Maybe Rachel doesn’t,"  Stephanie noted,her eyes glued to the television.  "But that girlcertainly does."        The wide 35 inch screen was now filledwith the image of a large breasted blonde whowas giving quite a demonstration in the art offellatio.  The young man’s cock she hadswallowed practically whole was also quiteimpressive.        "She is good at it,"  Penny laughed.  "Maybe you should take notes, Rachel        Rachel made a disapproving face.        "Yeah, like that guys really that big!  I’llbet that’s as fake as that bimbo’s tits."        "Looks pretty real to me."  Penny said.        "Special effects,"  Rachel suggested. "Youcan’t tell me you’ve ever seen a guy that big forreal."        "I have ... "  Stephanie started to saywithout thinking, then caught herself."        It was a momentary slip of the tongue, buteach of the other girls caught it immediately.        "Tell, tell."  they both called out.  "Truthor Dare.  You know the rules."        It was a game they had played amongthemselves, a game of sexual secrets.  If any ofthem admitted to a sexual secret, they had to tellor take a dare.  The dares had sometimes been farworse than the truth.           "Come on Stef,"  Penny encouraged. "Truth or Dare?" she added with wicked emphasison the second choice."         Stephanie considered the possibleconsequences of a dare for a brief moment, thendecided on the truth.        "Robby McPherson."  she answered in alow voice.        "What was that?"  Rachel asked, cuppingher hand around her ear as if she was hard ofhearing.        "Robby McPherson!"  Stephanie repeatedin a louder voice.        "Robby McPherson!"  Penny also repeatedin an even louder voice.        "That computer geek who worked at themall last summer,"  Rachel chimed in. "ThatRobby McPherson?"               "Yes."  Stephanie responded simply.        "What the hell where you thinking?" Rachel asked.        "I can’t believe you dated that loser." Penny added when Stephanie didn’t reply.        "He was not a loser!"  Stephanie snappedback.  "And I didn’t date him ...  I fucked him! There I said it, are you happy." she added, takinga large drink from her wine glass.           "Shit, Stef, that’s even worse."  Rachelsaid.  "Why would you do a thing like that?"        In reply, Stephanie held up both hands andbrought them together until they stopped aboutnine inches apart.  Her meaning was obvious toher friends.  It was a gesture they’d use inreference to guys many times.  The only differencewas that this time it wasn’t a diminutive allusion.        "You’re shitting me."  Rachel said, eyeingthe gap between her hands.        "Honest truth."  Stephanie said, a termnone of them would ever lie about.        "Fuck!"  Rachel exclaimed.  "Who’d haveever thought it."                "Wait a minute,"  Penny cut them off. "Not so fast."        Stephanie and Rachel both turned to theirgirlfriend.        "Look, I’m willing to accept that maybeRobby McPherson, jerk that he might have been,is hung like a horse. And I’ll even admit that giventhe chance, anyone of us would’ve fucked himtoo.  But there is no way that you could’ve knownthat before you hopped into bed with him!"        "Actually, it was the back seat of his Dad’scar."  Stephanie grinned.  "And I did know, mybrother Jerry told me."        Both girls remembered Jerry Morgan hadalso worked at the mall last summer.  In fact, hehad been one of the few people who had beenfriends with Robby.        "How would Jerry know how big he was?" Rachel asked.  "And why would he tell you?"        "The same way I know Judy Peterman hasa large birthmark mole on her ass: the locker roomshowers."  Stephanie said.  "And as to the why, Iasked him once out of idle curiosity who had thebiggest cock in the mall."        "I still don’t buy it,"  Penny said.  "If mybrother asked me which girl in the shower had thebest boobs, I can’t imagine answering him.  And Idefinitely can’t imagine me asking him to checkout cocks for me -- or have him actually do it if Idid."                   "Well, maybe he would,"  Stephanieanswered with a devious smile on her face.  "Ifyou’d gotten him laid."        "You got him laid?"  Penny asked indisbelief.        "Well he thinks I got him laid," Stephanieadmitted.  "Actually all I did was introduce him toGloria Nelson."        "You got him laid," Rachel stated withauthority.  "All you had to do was introduce himto that teencock hungry bitch."                Gloria Nelson was a 37 year-old assistantmanager at the Oakdale Mall.  Twice divorced, itwas no secret among most of the women whoworked there that the redhead had a weakness forbarely legal boys.  Her various sexual escapadeswould have been enough to get her fired, if not forthe fact that her family was one of the mostprominent in town.          Unless one of her conquests turned out tobe underage -- she was always very careful aboutthat -- or one of the young men filed a complaint,even more unlikely after she had freely given themwhat they all would agree was one hot piece ofass -- Gloria would continue with her littleappetites.             "I guess that would be enough to get himto check out some cocks for you."  Penny finallyadmitted.         "To be honest, since that’s the nature ofthe game,"  Stephanie mused,  "I think most guys,Jerry included, do check the others out, to seehow they compare with each other.  They justdon’t want to admit they look at other guys."        "That’s probably true." both girls agreed,remembering secretly checking out classmates inthe showers back when they all started to develop.         "Now can we forget about all this andwatch the movie or something?"  Stephanie asked.            "Okay,"  Penny agreed.  "But I’m still madat you for one thing."        "What’s that?"  Stephanie asked somewhatconfused.        "You knew that twerp had a 9-inch cockand you didn’t tell any of the rest of us!"        All three of them burst into laughter asRachel refilled all their glasses.            For the next three quarters of an hour, thegirls watched the adult film, offering jokes andcomments about what they saw.  Also during thattime they finished off the first bottle of wine andworked their way halfway through a second.Rachel had also thrown a bag of popcorn into themicrowave. After all, what fun was a moviewithout popcorn?         The plot of the movie, such as there wasof one, was that of an adult television station trying to pick its new fall line-up.  A mixture ofmen and women sat in a boardroom, watchingshort clips of various pilots.  It was one such showthat the girls had already watched.  The clips wereshort on plot but long on sex.  As they went on,the members of the selection committee becamemore and more aroused.  A condition each of thegirls could sympathize with, even if they didn’twant to admit it.         The appearance of a small Asian womanon the screen brought immediate comments fromRachel and Stephanie that she resembled Penny, though in fact the multicultrual girl was differenteverywhere beyond Asian features and similarheight.        "I don’t look like that,"  Penny declared inmock protest, adding with a laugh,  "I have muchnicer tits."          It didn’t take long for the Asian actress tobecome involved with her male co-star.  In fact, ittook less than two minutes for these supposedlytotal strangers to get naked and go at it.  As theydid, Penny’s friends continued to remark at howmuch the girl on the screen really looked like her.        "I don’t know Penny,"  Stephanie musedas she watched the actress deep throat the manwho was as generously endowed as the actor inthe first clip.  "We’ve double dated and I have tosay, that sure looks like you."         "Yeah, are you sure you haven’t beenmoonlighting?"  Rachel chimed in.        "Why?"  Penny laughed.  "Are youjealous?"        Their friendly barbs continued as theon-screen couple continued their endeavors.  Theman climbed behind the girl and positioned hiscock against her ass.  With a loud grunt, hepushed his manhood inside her, accompanied bysqueals of encouragement from his partner.        "Ouch!"  Stephanie cried.  "That’s got tohurt!"        "Well, that proves that’s not me."  Pennygrimaced.  ‘This little ass is much too tight forsomething that big."  she quipped as she pattedher bottom.        "I don’t know,"  Rachel mused.  "I’veheard that if it’s done right it can be quite fun. After all, isn’t that what gay guys do?  There hasto be something pleasurable about it."        "Well when you find out, you can let therest of us know."  Stephanie retorted, wonderingif perhaps her friend had already tried it and didn’twant to admit it.                Another scene change brought an olderwoman in her forties to the screen, already ridingatop a young man who couldn’t be far out of histeens.  Almost immediately all three of them calledout the name of Gloria Nelson.  The fact that thiswoman was a brunette instead of a redheadmattered little.          "I guess that makes that your brother Jerrylaying underneath her."  Penny offered.        "No way,"  Stephanie retorted.  "Mybrother has a much better bod."        As one, Penny and Rachel snapped theirheads around to look in astonishment.        "Oh come on, you both have brothers." Stephanie added tartly. "You can’t tell me thatsomewhere along the line you haven’t gotten apeek at them, just like I’m sure they’ve gotten apeek at you."        Silence gave truth to her assertion.  It wasobvious that the wine, and the movie, were muchresponsible for her frankness.           Back on the screen, the Gloria Nelsonsurrogate was riding the younger man like a rodeorider atop a bull.  Her large unrestrained breastsbouncing in all directions.  The look of ecstasy onher face was a powerful enticement to the joys ofteenage boys.                "What do you think will happen first?" Penny asked.  "He pops his cork or that bedcollapses beneath them?"            "I’d say 50 - 50 either way."  Rachelanswered.        "I’ll go with his popping his cork," Stephanie bet. "That bed is stronger than it looks."        Less than an minute later, Stephanie wonthe bet as "Gloria" suddenly jumped off the youngman and spun around on the bed, her hand neverreleasing it’s grip on his hard cock.  Soon as thebrunette’s face reached his boyhood, it explodedin a shower of hot whiteness, covering her eagerlips and cheeks with his eruption.                The preview faded from view, to bereplaced by another scene.  It looked like thelocker room of the local high school.  From offcamera, the sound of running water could beheard from the showers.        "Anyone care to guess what kind of scenethis one is going to be?"  Penny asked, turning themovie into a sort of guessing game.        "My guess is the Quarterback andCheerleader."  Rachel said as she tossed half ahandful of popcorn into her mouth.        "Teacher and Student’s my guess." Stephanie said.        "I’m going to go with a gang bang." Penny offered with a wicked grin.        The Asian girl won that round as the starof the little epic, a tall statuesque blonde dressedin a very tight white uniform came into the lockerroom.  Evidently she was supposed to be theschool nurse.  She acted surprised when the soundof running water ceased and a half dozen nakedhunks walked into view.          In no time at all, the busty blonde waslaying on one of the benches, a stiff member ineach of her hands, a hard one in her mouth, afourth and fifth in her shaved pussy and tight ass. Standing just off to the right of the after-schoolorgy was the best looking of all the guys, playfullystroking the largest cock of the group and waitingfor an opening he could put it into.            "Guess she never heard of the idea thatyou can have too much of a good thing."  Rachelcommented.        "Maybe,"  Penny said.  "But I’d be glad totake care of the odd man out there."        "Get in line girl."  Stephanie cut in.                For so energetic a scene, it turned out tobe surprisingly short.  The odd man out never didfind his hole, but joined in with his buddies ingiving the nurse a cum shower.        "Well, so much for the idea that more isbetter."  Rachel said.        "Yeah, I think I prefer my sex one onone,"  Stephanie added.        "Me too,"  Penny chimed in.  "Well, maybetwo on one, but no more than that.  Except maybeon special occasions of course."                Rachel and Stephanie both laughed, notsure how much of Penny’s statement was intendedas a joke.         The scene shifted back to the boardroomwere several of the network executives were nowin various stages of undress, already engaged in sexual acts.  One of the female executives, a darkhaired thirty year old, was spread across the table,her dress up around her waist, her legs spreadwide.  Buried between those legs was the face of amale executive.  Kneeing beside that man was oneof the secretaries, her own mouth wrapped tightlyaround the cock sticking out from his threehundred dollar suit.          At the head of the table, the silver-grayhaired chairman of the board was also missing thelower half of his high priced suit, his own cockhowever was not as visible.  Instead it was buriedin the red-haired mound of the second secretarywho was being mounted doggie style by the seniorexecutive.          At the head of the room, the narrator ofthe film, who had also introducing the TV pilots,was trying to ignore the spectacle before him. Hecontinued to tell about the last show on theagenda.  It began to run on the monitor as thenarrator threw up his hand in surrender and pulledout his cock, sliding it into the mouth of theredhead.         The boardroom image faded, replaced bythe kitchen of a small apartment.  Standing at thecounter, her back to the camera, was a youngHispanic woman in her twenties.  Wearing a pairof cut off shorts and a red and white striped tanktop, she was pouring herself a cup of coffee.  Asshe turned to face the camera, a second cup became visible on the counter.  A smile crossed herlips as she tasted the steaming liquid.        Another figure then entered the kitchen, alight skinned brunette wearing a blue bathrobe.Her tousled short hair gave added evidence thatshe had just gotten out of bed. Pushing a lock ofloose hair away from her eyes, she accepted thesecond cup of coffee. In a brief chat the newarrival's name was revealed as Donna and thecoffee maker's as Modesta.         In no time at all, Donna’s robe fell opened,revealing a soft body accented by small curvingmounds, the pink nipples of which were both hardand visible.  The cup at her lips was quicklyreplaced by the equally hot lips of her companion.         With dazzling speed, the darker skinnedgirl traced a wet path down from the brunettes lipsto her breast. The nipple of which quicklydisappeared between her lips.         "Oh my!"  Stephanie gasped as shewatched the onscreen encounter advance to thenext stage.  She had crossed the room to pick upsome more muchies, but had stopped in mid stepat the sight.          In no time at all, Modesta's attentiondropped below her companion’s waist.  Stephaniehad seen women kiss each other on a few daringtelevision shows, had even seen them caress eachother’s breasts in an R rated film, but never hadshe seen a woman performing oral sex on anotherwoman.        The camera zoomed in, giving a close upview of Modesta’s tongue darting up and into thepink recesses of Donna’s pussy.  The picture wasso vivid that Stephanie could see the shiny layer ofnectar Modesta’s ministrations had produced.        ‘God, could you ever imagine doingsomething like that?"  Stephanie asked, her eyesnever leaving the screen.                It took a few long seconds for her torealize her friends hadn’t answered -- which shefound unusual.  She couldn’t ever remember thembeing at a loss for words!        "Could you ever imagine doing anythinglike that?"  she repeated, assuming they hadn’theard her.                The continued silence finally broke herfixation on the screen.  She turned her attentionback to Rachel.  The look on her girlfriend’s facewas akin to that of a kid who’d been caught witha hand in the cookie jar.                       "You’re kidding!"  Stephanie declared.        "Well, if you can be honest about RobbyMcPherson, then I should be honest too."  Rachel admitted.        "I don’t believe it,"  Stephanie said.  "Ithink now you’re putting me on.  Who have youever done it with?"                Rachel took a moment to think about heranswer.  Stephanie expected Rachel to say somedistant friend, if anything.  Instead the brunettelooked past the blond to the other end of the     couch.        Stephanie followed her line of sight, untilit stopped on an equally guilty face.        "Oh no, you had me going for a moment," Stephanie said, a touch of amusement in her tone."But now you’re stretching this a bit too far  --just a little bit over the top.  That was almost asgood as that story you had me believing aboutTracy Conway last month.                Tracy Conway was a somewhat masculinewoman in her thirties who also worked in the Mallat a sporting goods store.  One night, following afew hours of bar-hopping, the other girls hadconvinced Stephanie that Tracy was female as theresult of  a sex change operation.  It tookStephanie a week to discover it had been a joke.          Stephanie looked again at both of herfriends.  Neither one of them were laughing thistime.  Instead they shared a silent communication.        Without a word Penny got up from thecouch and walked past Stephanie. When shereached Rachel, the young Asian woman reachedup and gently stroked her cheek.  Then she pulledthe taller woman down to her level and kissed heron the lips.          It was a soft kiss at first, the kind that onefriend might give another, no different than someStephanie herself had gotten.  Then it becamemore and more erotic, a melding of lips and eagertongues.  Rachel responded in turn, pressing hardagainst the younger girl.        Stephanie was still trying to decide if thiswas a gag when Penny pushed the game evenfurther.  She slipped her hand up under Rachel’sT-shirt and fondled the naked flesh beneath it.         Breaking the kiss, she pulled up the thinmaterial and planted kisses on Rachel’s nowexposed breasts as well. Mimicking Modesta’sactions on the cable station, Penny slid her tongueunder Rachel’s erect nipple and guided it into hermouth.               "Shit,"  Stephanie finally exclaimed in arush of air. "This isn’t a joke."        With that, the two lovers ended theirembrace and faced their friend.  Their faces nowreflected a look of expectation.                Glancing back at the TV image, Stephanienoted that the two woman were now locked in a69 position, their mouths pressed tightly in eachother’s wet mounds.  What truly startled her wasthat, in her mind, instead of Donna and Modesta,the forms she now saw pressed together werethose of Rachel and Penny.                "Is it really as much fun as it looks?"  shewondered out loud.        In reply, she felt a soft hand come to reston her shoulder.           "We’d be happy to show you if you’rereally interested."  Rachel said.  "The only reasonwe never asked before is we weren’t sure of howyou’d react."        "Then why did you tell me now?" Stephanie asked.        "Honestly, I’m not sure,"  Stephanielaughed softly, trying to break the underlyingtension. "I didn’t plan it this way, it just seemedthe perfect time."        Stephanie thought about it for a briefmoment and decided that events had indeed madethis the perfect time.  The wine, the conversationthey’d been having had put them all at ease withwhat would normally have been a very awkwardsubject.        "And if  I thought that this wasn’t the sortof thing for me?"  Stephanie asked.        "Then I hope we’d just forget it all andstill be the same friends we all were 10 minutesago." Rachel replied.              Stephanie again looked past Rachel toPenny.  The younger girl hadn’t said a single wordsince Stephanie’s revelation.  She didn’t have to.The look in her eyes and on her face was amixture of apprehension and lust.        "Well I’ve always said,"  Stephanie said,placing her hand atop Rachel’s.  "You should tryeverything in life -- at least once."          She shifted her body ever so slightly, justenough to bring herself face to face with Rachel. Leaning forward, she pressed her lips against her.                It wasn’t the first time she had ever kissedRachel.  There had been many occasions when shekissed other girls, but never like this.  The touchof their lips now seemed electric.  A warmthspread throughout their bodies from that briefcontact.  The kiss was at the same time both briefand endless.          Still unsure of the situation, Rachel letStephanie take the lead.  It wasn’t until the blondkissed her a second time that Rachel began torespond.        Stephanie closed her eyes and the passionbuilding within her take control. She pushed hertongue into Rachel’s mouth, exploring thesoftness of it’s mirror image.        Rachel took hold of Stephanie’s hands andpressed them against her breasts. Tentatively, sheexplored the material covered mounds.  It was thefirst time she had ever felt the softness of aanother woman’s breast, the hardness of erectnipples.        As Stephanie continued to explore herfriends body, Rachel slid her own hands up anddown her friend’s back.  She took hold of thezipper of her dress and pulled it down, exposingthe flesh beneath it.  She caressed that flesh,running her nails across it.                The touch of a new hand caused Stephanieto open her eyes.  Penny now stood next to her aswell, a wide smile on her face.  Stephanie shiftedher attention to the youngest of her friends andkissed her too.  A kiss equal in intensity to thatshe had just given Rachel.  To Stephanie’s delight,the reaction she felt to it was also the same.        The three young women stood interlockedin the center of the room, kissing, exploring eachothers bodies, loosening clothing and searchingout the flesh beneath it.        "Maybe we should all just take a minuteand get comfortable."  Rachel suggestion.         The other’s nodded their agreement, andthey all took a few steps back from each other. Rachel was wearing the least so it took her only afew seconds to drop her shirt and panties to thefloor.  Standing naked in the center of the roomfor the second time that night, she took a momentto shut off the television. There was no longer anyneed for it, not when a much more interestingentertainment was about to commence.        Penny and Stephanie took only a littlelonger.  A small pile of clothes rested at eachgirl’s feet, topped by undergarments of variousdesigns.  Now they all stood naked, looking ateach other during an awkward pause.        Only a short time before, Stephanie hadfelt a little strange looking at Rachel’s nakedbody. Now she looked with a different eye.  All ofthem took a moment to look at each other.         Stephanie was surprised to see that Pennyhad shaved the hair between her legs.  She knewfrom brief glimpses that there never had beenmuch there to begin with.  But the absence of thatlittle bit made the small girl seem even more like ateenager. Rachel on the other hand, had a widepatch of dark brown hair.  Stephanie’s own bushwas somewhere between the two extremes and alight blond.        Even their breasts formed a sharp contrast, not just in size, ranging from Rachel’s 38C toPenny’s 34B, but in the very shape of them. Stephanie’s were very rounded with wide pinkcircles around short pink nipples.  Rachel’smounds were conical in nature with puffy areolasthat stuck out even further.  Penny had the darkestnipples of the three, a rich dark brown againstbutternut skin.                  "So now what?"  Stephanie asked as shetossed her hands up in the air.        "Why don’t you make yourselfcomfortable on the couch," Rachel suggested witha smile.  "and let us take care of getting thingsstarted."        Thinking it not a bad suggestion at all,Stephanie sat down on the center of the widecouch.  Rachel and Penny sat down beside her,tossing the larger throw pillows onto thehardwood floor.  They would come in handy later.        Penny kissed Stephanie.  Then Rachelkissed Stephanie.  Then, leaning across the middlegirl, Penny kissed Rachel.  As they did, they eachcupped the closest of Stephanie’s breasts, playingtheir fingers across her nipples - enjoying thestiffness found there.        Stephanie couldn’t help but compare thetouch of the two women to that of men she’dknown.  For the most part, it was softer -- yet atthe same time much more erotic.  As were the sensations it produced.  Even more pleasing werethe waves of delight that filled her breasts whenthose skillful fingers where replaced with evenmore talented mouths.         Matching tongues traced a path acrosssupple flesh, until they met in the rich valleybetween the mounds.  There the two lovers kissedonce more before parting in different directions.         Penny continued to kiss and caressStephanie’s breasts, alternating between softtouches and gentle bites.  Working her way backto Stephanie’s willing mouth, she pressed herdarker breasts hard against the those of the girlbeneath her. The nipple to nipple contact wasenough to elicit a soft moan from Stephanie.  Amoan cut short by the crush of Penny’s mouth.        Rachel had moved her attentions lower,dropping down to sit on one of the oversizedcushions.  With a hand on each of Stef’s thighs,she spread them apart to expose the blond-framedpearl.        Burying her head between the pale legs,Rachel ran her tongue along the length of herfriend’s womanhood -- her heart racing withexcitement at the idea that she was the firstwoman ever to do so.  The scent of Stephanie’salready damp mound was intoxicating, a feastwaiting to be savored.         Not to be denied, she drove her tongue upbetween the folds of those sugar walls, clearing apath to the clitoris.  A path quickly followed.        "Oh God!!"  Stephanie gasped as she feltRachel’s tongue strike her like the spark to amatch.  It was enough for her to momentaryforget the girl still playing with both her breastsand mouth.          But only for a moment as Penny liftedherself higher and guided one of her own richmounds to Stephanie’s lips.  Her mouth still openfrom her gasp, Penny pushed her erect nipplebetween the blonde’s red lips.        There had often been times whenStephanie had often wondered what it might feellike to suck on a woman’s breasts.  Her ownmounds were too small to try it on herself.  She’dincluded sucking on a man’s nipples as part of herloveplay, but she was sure it wasn’t the same.        Now with the reality between her teeth,she knew that her earlier conclusion was right. Playing with a man’s nipples was nothing like thereal thing of a woman.  She could taste Penny in away that she never could a man, delighting in themixture of soft and hard.  She ran her tongue backand forth across the dark, pert tips, trying torepeat the pleasing affect that Penny had producedin her.           As the now saturated nipple slipped fromher lips, Penny wrapped her hands around theback of Stephanie’s head, guiding her face to thesoft spot between her breasts, inviting her to feastthere as well, an invitation Stephanie was all toowilling to accept.  She licked her way across thedamp skin, enjoying the heady aroma filling hernostrils. Then with girlish delight she repeated herperformance on Penny’s other mound.        Her interest still fixed on Stephanie’spussy, Rachel slid one finger, then another deepwithin it.  The initial wetness she found there increased as she moved her fingers back and forth. With their motion waves of enchantmentexpanded to fill Stephanie’s relaxed form.        Rachel augmented the touch of her fingerswith that of her tongue, reaching her friend’s mostsensitive spots as if they were familiar as her own. In truth many of them were identical.          If Stephanie had time to think about it --which her two friends were definitely not allowing-- she might have appreciated the irony of thesituation.  Rachel, who cringed at the thought oftaking a man in her mouth, had no such hesitationwhere another woman was involved.        "This feels so fucking good!"  Stephaniemoaned as she laid back and enjoyed thetwo-pronged assault on her body.  "I don’t thinkI’ve ever felt this fantastic."         As Penny climbed off Stephanie, Rachelalso moved back.  Together they guided theirneophyte lover onto the large pillows they hadearlier tossed to the floor.  As soon as Stephanielaid across the pillows, Rachel again spread herlegs and went right back to where she left off.        Penny had other ideas.  It was timeStephanie learned how to give as well as receive.Squatting over Stephanie’s face, Penny droppeddown until her pussy was only a few inches aboveit.        Prior to this moment, Stephanie had neverseen another woman’s sex close up.  The fact thatPenny’s was totally hairless gave it an even moreinteresting perspective.  The first thing she noticedwas that for such a small girl, Penny had anunusually large clitoris. It was almost like a tinypenis.         No imagination was needed for Stephanieto figure out what Penny wanted. Unlike Rachel,Stephanie never had a problem with oral sex, sowith virginal enthusiasm, she reached out with hertongue and ran it across Penny’s erect clit.        "Oh yeah baby,"  Penny panted.  "Go forit!"        Go for it Stephanie did, pulling Penny’sclit between her lips, massaging it with hertongue.  Then she swept it back across the lengthof Penny’s pussy, savoring her first taste of awoman.          The scent of Penny's sex was almostoverpowering, and to her delight she learned withher first lick that the taste was all she hoped itwould be.  Penny lowered her pelvis further sothat Stephanie could have easier access to her wetcunt.          Slowly at first, Stephanie licked theyounger girl, exploring her womanhood.  Thenshe began to quicken the pace until she reached arhythm that sent little ripples throughout Penny'sbody.          Ripples that mirrored those fillingStephanie's body as Rachel continued to workmagic between her legs.  As one hand continuedto slide outstretched fingers up and down theblond framed love canal, the brunette’s other handworked the same enchantment on her own -- withmuch the same results.        Faster and faster all three of them went,plunging down the well of ecstasy.  It was a raceto rapture - a pursuit each wanted to win.          To her surprise, Stephanie produced thefirst orgasm as Penny’s body suddenly convulsedagainst her mouth and it filled with a blast ofhoney.  It was such a sexual rush that it sentStephanie’s own body over the edge, showering Rachel with the same gift.  A reward she hungrilyaccepted.        Finally, Rachel joined the chorus, meremoments behind the others, propelled by thesymphony of her fingers                  "Oh my god!"  Stephanie exclaimed asthey laid naked on the floor, still entwined in eachother’s bodies.  "I can’t believe how intense thatwas.  How did you ever get the idea to trysomething like this ... and how long have you beendoing it?"                "Well it was originally Penny’s idea." Rachel replied, running her hand alongsidePenny’s cheek.  "And we’ve been doing it, as youcall it, for the last six months."        Stephanie turned to Penny, but before shecould ask the question on her lips, Pennyanswered it with a laugh.        "I’ve been doing it since I was 16. Whatcan I say?  I’ve always been an advanced learner."                 The other two girls joined in the laughteras they continued to stroke and kiss each other. They all knew what had just happened was onlythe beginning.  There would be many more littleadventures in their collective future.                "Err ... Rachel,"  Stephanie suddenly askedseriously.  "Remember what you said earliertonight about the nameplate on the door?"        "Of course,"  Rachel answered, wonderingwhy Stephanie was suddenly concerned aboutsomething so mundane.        "I think you might want to try andremember that a little harder in the future." Stephanie continued.                "Oh shit!" Penny cried out abruptly, cutting off any further inquiry Rachel might havehad about Stephanie’s sudden tangent.                Rachel followed Penny’s gaze until allthree of them were looking at the front doorway. An entrance now filled by the tall figure of a darkskinned young woman in a bright red raincoat,holding a silver keychain in her hand.                "Fuck!"  Rachel blurted out," "Pamela!"        They all sat silent after that for longseconds,  like statues in some far off garden.                "Looks like I missed one hell of a party." Pamela said as she pulled off her raincoat anddraped it over a wall hook, revealing a bluebusiness suit.  "And here I thought I knew whatkind of people my friends were." she said in a hurttone.                 "Oh fuck!"  Rachel repeated.  The othertwo girls were still too stunned to say anythingelse.                "I am disappointed in you all,"  Pameladeclared as she stepped into the room and stoodover the naked trio.  "I thought we were supposedto be the Four Musketeers!"                It took a few seconds for them to realizethat the oldest of their little group wasn’t reallyangry or shocked at all. In fact, it was nowbecoming obvious that she hadn’t just walked ineither. How long she’d been watching was anquestion unasked -- at least for now.          With smiles now filling their faces, allthree girls reached up and pulled Pamela downinto the center of their circle.  She seemed a littleout of place with her conservative attire, butwithin a few minutes that was gone as well.  Herdark form was soon covered by an intermix oflighter hues.                Hours later, long after the rain hadstopped and the night once more grew quiet, thesounds of passion could still be heard.  Thequartet truly learned the meaning of their motto. One for all, and all for one.    END #*#
 MARKHAM FAMILY HISTORY MARKHAMThe noble Markham line can be traced to well before 1066.Alexander Markham, born 1130, was the first man of note - havingdistinguished himself in the wars of King Stephen. He was castellan orSheriff of Nottingham during the reign of Richard I and into that ofJohn - the period of Robin Hood. His great grandson, William theBishop of Wells, was Lord Treasurer of England from 1290 to 1295.Three generations later, John - a Judge of CommonPleas, put the Prince of Wales in prison after the Prince slapped him.See Shakespeare's "Henry the IV", Part two, Act 1, scenetwo, for a mention of this. This Sir John became Lord Chief Justice ofEngland from 1396-1406.  In 1470 Sir Robert, who fought on the side ofthe White Roses, was Sheriff of Nottingham as were several of hisdescendants.  Sir Robert, born 1536 was a M.P. in 1571 and HighSheriff in 1571 and 1589. Sir Robert, born 1563, was knighted by JamesI on May 11, 1603 and squandered the family fortune and its estate ofCotham.  Sir Clements Markham speculated that Daniel Markham of Cambridge,MASS, alive in 1667 was Robert's grandson through either Robert born 1596 orAlexander born 1601.  Traditionally, Daniel came to America on thefirst ship after the Mayflower, the "Speedwell", as one ofits 5 unknown passengers. He was a Deacon in 1690.Mark Goodmansen, who may be contacted at MGoodmanse@aol.com, has done thefollowing truly great research on the first Markham in America. The followingis reproduced with his kind permission.The purpose of this article is to present the English roots of Deacon DanielMarkham of Massachusetts and Connecticut based on research developed over thelast several years. The authority for my conclusions are based primarily on acourt case in Massachusetts where Daniel Markham was deposed as a witnessregarding the sale of a horse.  Additionally, a will of a kinsman written inLondon in 1639 further corroborates this conclusion. Other sources arereferenced to clarify or support the original sources.In the fertile soil of the Colne River Valley lies the quaint town of EarlsColne. The parish records originating there identify these two families:James Markham married Martha Collins on October 11, 1632They had the following children:1. James - Baptized April 16342. Margaret - Baptized Aug 18, 16363. John - Baptized Feb 21, 16384. Daniel - Baptized June 22, 16415. William - Baptized  June 22, 16456. Martha - Baptized Mar 21, 16467. Mathew  - Baptized 16498. Phoebe - Baptized April 3, 1655Abraham Markham married Alice Turner, also of Earls Colne, and had severalchildren, one of whom was Nathaniel Markham, born in 1642.The noted historian, J. Gardner, in his article, The English Ancestral Homesof the Founders of Cambridge, estimated from his research that nearlytwo-thirds of the early English colonists were from Suffolk, Essex, andHertfordshire Counties. He also observed:"The early founders of New England did not generally come here at random bymere families and locate haphazard in the various settlements. On thecontrary, the colonization was in large parties of families, relatives, andfriends who had been acquainted and associated in England, emigrated togetherunder the leadership of their respective non-conforming ministers, andlocated together in New England."The Rev. Thomas Shepherd, like Rev. Hooker, became an active proponent forthe Puritan cause. From 1627 to 1631, he was a lecturer in Earls Colne, Essexand generated a large following.  Having been silenced by Archbishop Laud, heremoved to Yorkshire and Northumberland.  During his last few years inEngland, as recorded in his diary, he stayed for a time with the Russell,Collins, and Harlakendon families in and around Ipswitch and Earls Colne.On the ship, The Defence, the Rev. Shepherd with several parishioners,including John Russell and Roger Harlakendon, set sail for New England in1635. Accompanying them in this settlement was Mr. Edward Collins.Edward Collins went on to establish himself in nearby Medford, where heacquired Gov. Craddock's massive estate, and later sold 1600 acres of hisplantation to Richard Russell. The first preserved documentation from Englandthat Daniel Markham, born in June 1641, in Earls Colne, was the same as theCambridge, Mass. Resident is provided by the will of a Daniel Collins,written in 1639 and probated in 1643. In it, he leaves fifty pounds Britishcurrency to "the wife of Cousin Markham." In the same will, he mentions hisbrother, Samuel, Vicar of Braintree, and Edward Collins, "now in NewEngland," and names several children of Edward Collins.He also mentioned his mother was buried at Braintree. The town of Braintreeis in Essex, next to Earls Colne. Daniel Collins referred to "the lease ofthe Dolphin." There is property named, "The Dolphin, in Halstead, which alsoborders Earls Colne. This property is mentioned in the records of Earls Colnin association with other plots of ground, which have been identified withJames Markham, which also was held by a John Collins prior to James Markham.In 1670, Daniel Markham, then also of Medford, Mass., was deposed to testifyon behalf of Edward Collins, plaintiff, involving an alleged theft of a mareand colt by a neighbor. During his testimony, he, Daniel, on severaloccasions referred to Mr. Collins as his uncle. The court reporter mentionedthat the deponent, Daniel Markham, "was aged 25 years or thereabouts," whichis consistent with the christening records of Earls Colne, which would puthim at the age of 27 at this time. (Court records of Middlesex County, Mass)By his own words, as recorded in the Mass. Court records, Daniel Markhamidentifies his uncle Edward Collins. From England, Daniel Collins, in hiswill, identifies his cousin Markham (referring to James Markham and his wifeMartha Collins) and his relative, Edward Collins, in New England. And, inEarls Colne, Essex, we have documented the marriage of James Markham andMartha Collins, who had a son, Daniel, born in 1641.During the course of his life, various incidents further corrororate theserelationships. These include the following:1) Daniel Markham named his second son, James (after his father), and adaughter Martha (after his mother). Naming children after parents was commonpractice then.2) On March 29, 1675, Daniel Markham purchased two acres of land in Medfordfrom Edward Collins. (From the Medford Mass. Land Records, Salt Lake FamilyHistory Center Microfilm #532455; V.6; pages 240-249)3) After the death of his first wife, Elizabeth, he removed to Middletown,Conn., and married Patience Harris. His neighbors in Middletown includedSamuel and the Rev. Nathaniel Collins. Both of them were sons of EdwardCollins of Cambridge, Mass.4) On the church records of Middletown, Daniel Markham was presented to thatcongregation on June 25, 1678. He was identified as having been from thecongregation of the Church of Christ at Cambridge. This is the same churchwhere Rev. Hooker began, and was replaced by Rev. Shepherd, who hadpreviously preached in Earls Colne, England. (From the Middletown ChurchRecords, Salt Lake Family History Library, Microfilm #4848, page 12)5) Daniel Markham loaned money to Samuel Collins. Samuel Collins providedthat Daniel Markham conduct an inventory of his possessions upon his death.(Digest of Early Conn. Probate Records, V.1, pages 429-430)6) Nathaniel Markham of Charlestown, Mass. Died Sept 26, 1673 in the home ofMr. Collins. (Charlestown Vital Records; Vol 1; Part 1; page 22). The parishrecords of Earls Colne, Essex, England, list a Nathaniel Markham, born May30, 1642 to Abraham Markham and Alice Turner Markham. Being near the sameage, and from the same town, it seems likely that Daniel and Nathanielemigrated together. Possibly, because of the kinship of Daniel and Nathanieland the kinship of Daniel and Edward Collins, Nathaniel was befriended by Mr.Collins until his death in 1673.In conclusion, I believe that the above clearly establishes that DeaconDaniel Markham of Cambridge, Mass. And Middletown Conn. was the son of JamesMarkham and Martha Collins, of Earls Colne, and that he was born in 1641.During the last few years I have been trying to find the answer to the nextobvious question. Does Deacon Daniel descend from the royal Markham family ofNottinghamshire?My research, while in England, and from various locations and sources in theUnited States, has identified several, very strong clues that support that hedid descend from a known branch of the Markham family of Nottinghamshire. Ihope to be able to publish these findings soon, but I would like to find moredocumentation first.  I also intend to publish a biography of Deacon DanielMarkham, including some extremely fascination new information about him whilein England and in the colonies.This research makes the previous speculations about connection to the nobleMarkham line more problematic.The brother ofEbenezer, our ancestor, was Jeremiah, born 1735 and owner of all shipironworks in CT.

One For AllOne For All ...by Ann Douglas        Stepping into the building vestibule,Stephanie Morgan shook the water from herumbrella. It had only been a little over two blockwalk from the bus stop, but she had gotten soakednevertheless. Opening her raincoat, the 24 yearold blond made an attempt to shake that dry aswell.        It had been bad luck that her brotherJerry’s car had picked tonight of all nights not tostart up.  He had promised to drop her off at herfriend Rachel’s new apartment. No matter, shereluctantly concluded, at least she was here now.        "Lets see,"  she mused as she ran herfinger across the row of intercom buttons."Alexander ... Markham ... Ford ...  here it is,Lieberman, 5B"        It took a few moments to get a response,then a semi-distorted voice filtered through thespeaker.        "Hello?"  the female voice asked.        "Rachel, it’s me Stef."  she replied.        "Come on up," Rachel said as the buzzersounded and the inner door unlocked.  "I’m in theshower."          "She’s in the shower?"  Stephanie laughedas she glanced back out into the rain coveredstreet.         As she walked up the stairs to the fifthfloor apartment, Stephanie couldn’t help but envyher girlfriends new accommodations.  To someonestill living at home, the small apartment complexmight has well been a palace. There was no waythe salesgirl could afford a place like this on hersalary.          Of course Rachel really couldn’t afford aplace like this on her salary either.  The buildingwas owned by Martin Lieberman, who whenasked by his widowed sister-in-law to help herdaughter find an apartment was more than happyto find her this one.  It was a small thing to makea woman he’d admired for years happy.  Besides,having his niece living here assured him a honestpair of eyes to watch over his investment.         Reaching the fifth floor of the smallapartment building, Stephanie found that therewere some limits to Mr. Lieberman's generosityafter all.  Apartment 5B was a small studioapartment, one of three on the top floor.  Tryingthe door, she found it unlocked and steppedinside.        "Rachel," the blue eyed blond called out asshe closed the door behind her.        "I'm in here, Stef," came a reply from the bathroom, a voice much more recognizable thanthe one that had come over the intercom.  "Makeyourself comfortable and  I'll be out in a fewminutes."            Hanging her coat, on the rack by the door,Stephanie checked the short red dress she waswearing.  It was a little damp but otherwise okay.She had gotten home late and didn’t have time tochange clothes.          As she waited, Stephanie took in hersurroundings.  The apartment might be small, butit had a certain charm.  The first feature shenoticed were large twin skylights in the ceiling. The soft patter of rain could be heard againstthem.  On a clear day or night, they would give anice natural light to the room.        On the far left, a large bay window alsoadded to the natural light.  The view beyond itwas nothing special, but it was a nice feature.  A kitchenette over by the bathroom entranceconsisted of a small refrigerator, a stovetop and microwave. And of course a kitchen sink.        There really wasn't much in the way ofdecoration on the walls, but then Rachel had onlybeen living there a few weeks.  The center of theroom was dominated by a large green oversizedU-shaped sofa.  In addition to the deep cushions,it was covered with equally push and oversizedpillows.  Rachel had mentioned to her that sheused the sofa in place of a bed.        At the open end of the couch was one ofthose small self assembly entertainment centers, the bottom of  which was filled with her friend'sold stereo system . What was new was the large35-inch color television, a housewarming gift fromRachel's grandmother.  The couch had been onefrom her mother.        On both sides of the television were someframed photographs.  One brought a smile toStephanie’s face. The 5 x 7 picture was veryfamiliar to the 24 year old.  A smaller version wasstuck in the mirror frame in her own bedroom. The picture had been taken last summer at theOakdale Mall Talent Show.        Centered in the picture was Rachel ofcourse.  She always had to be the center ofattention.  To her right was Stephanie herself.That was when her hair had been down toher shoulders, rather than the short curly look shenow wore.        To Rachel's left was a much smaller girl,whose mixed Philippine, Chinese and Spanishheritage had given her a soft brown complexion. Her very short black hair and unisex featuresgave her an androgynous look.  In fact, if it wasn'tfor the small mounds protruding from her chest,she might've been mistaken for a teenage boy. Her name was Annie Liu, but everyone called herPenny.  Despite her teenage looks, she was 20years old.        The last member of the quartet was a tallblack woman standing just behind and to theleft of Rachel. Five foot ten, she stood half a headtaller than any of the others, more than that inthe case of Penny's five two. Her skin was ebonyblack, a sharp contrast to both Rachel andStephanie.  Most men first noticed her somewhatample bust.  In the case of women it was her jetblack hair which she usually wore in an elaboratedesign.  At 26, Pamela Wilson was the oldestmember of their little band.        All four women worked at the OakdaleMall. Rachel was a medical assistant.  Stephaniewas a sales representative at one of the large department stores.  Penny worked at her unclesrestaurant. She was also a college student. Pamela was the associate manager of  an officesupply store.        Despite their differences in ages andbackgrounds, they had all become friends overcountless shared lunches.  Soon their friendshipshad extended beyond work.  The picture hadcaptured one of the highlights of that friendship. Billing themselves as the Four Musketeers, sonamed because those were the only costumes theycould find, they had entered the talent showas a singing group.  It was more fun than hardwork and the money went to charity.  To theirsurprise, they finished in second place.  Since thenthey still jokingly referred to themselves as theFour Musketeers.        "We'd have gotten first,"  Stephaniethought as she replaced the picture on theentertainment center. "If we paraded around halfnaked like Judy Peterman.  The judges weremore impressed by her big nipples stickingthrough her blouse than her singing."        "Any sign of the rain letting up?"  Rachelasked as she walked out of the bathroom.        "No, it looks like tonight’s a totalwashout."  Stephanie replied as she turned aroundat the sound of her voice.        "A pity."  Rachel commented as shewalked over to Stephanie and kissed her on thecheek as a friendly hello.        Covered only by a large bath towel thatshe had wrapped around herself, Rachel walkedover to a large dresser that lined the far wall, stilldrying her hair as she walked.        "It really sucks that it had to rain tonight" Rachel said , pulling a pair of panties and anoversized T-shirt from the top drawer.  "I waslooking forward to that concert."        The original plan for the evening was for agirls night out.  One of their favorite local bandswas holding an open air concert in Marshall Park.They'd planned to take dinner a couple of blanketsand a few bottles of wine out to enjoy the music. Unfortunately Mother Nature had other ideas.  Sorather than let the night go to waste, they haddecided to have a girl's night in instead.        "Penny and Pamela are picking up thefood." Rachel said as she unwrapped the towelfrom around her and let it fall to the floor.  "I'mnot sure what they're getting, but knowing Pamelait's sure to be something interesting." she added asshe stood there nude as the day she was born.        "I guess so." Stephanie replied in anstrained tone.        Silly as she knew it was, Stephanie felt it alittle strange for her friend to be standing nude infront of her as they continued their conversation. It wasn't of course the first time she'd seen Rachelnaked.  They'd gone to the beach many times, aswell as clothes shopping both together and as partof the group.  They'd shared dressing rooms manytimes, but somehow it now seemed different --somewhat out of context maybe, standing nakedin the living room.  Then she reminded herself thatthis was also Rachel's bedroom, a place where itwas perfectly natural for her to be nude.        Stephanie also considered that she feltuncomfortable because when they'd first met,Rachel and she had almost the same physicalbuild, the main difference being Rachel's darkerbrown hair and slightly larger breasts.  Thatdifference had grown to more than a few poundsof extra weight on Stephanie. Despite assurancesfrom many of her friends that she looked betterwith the extra weight, which was still within thenorm for her size, she always felt self-consciousabout it. It was an outgrowth of her teen yearswhen she had actually been overweight.        It didn't take Rachel long to put on thepair of panties and the T-shirt she had taken out.Since she was home and not planning to go out,she didn't see the need for anything more.  Withher breasts still a little damp, Rachel's much darkernipples clearly showed through the thin cotton.        "Judy Peterman would’ve been  proud." Stephanie thought with a laugh as her discomfortpassed.        Fifteen minutes passed as the two of themsat on the couch and chatted. They had seeneach other that morning so it was more a matterof killing time until the others showed up thananything else.        "Oh by the way,"  Rachel said, "Remindme to give you keys to get in here before youleave. That way you can let yourself in the nexttime you come over. I've got one for Penny tooand I've already given one to Pamela."        "Okay,"  Stephanie answered.        "But be sure to check and make sure thatmy name shows in the peephole plate on thedoor."  Rachel grinned mischievously.  "Cause ifits blank, it means that I've got company and youshould definitely knock first."        Stephanie had to laugh at the warning.Although living at home didn't afford her theprivacy to use such a system, she'd heard about itfrom her cousin who used something like it atcollege.        The laughter was cut short by the sound ofthe intercom buzzer.  Rachel got up and pressedthe speaker button.        "Food delivery."  came the voice from thespeaker which both women recognized as Penny's.        In reply, Rachel reached up and hit thebutton that unlocked the front door.        "Come on up."  she said.                She then went and opened up theapartment door,  waiting for their friends to comeup.        "I wonder why Pamela didn't use her key?"she said.  "I hope she didn't loose it already.        The reason turned out to be even simpler.When Penny got to the top floor, Pamela wasn'twith her.        "I hope someone is going to give me ahand with this,"  the smaller girl called out as sheindicated the three shopping bags she wasburdened down with.  "These aren't exactly light."           Rachel grabbed the largest bag, surprisedby its weight.  It was obvious that it containedmore than take out food.            "Where’s Pamela?"  Rachel asked as sheled the shorter girl into the apartment.           "There was some sort of problem at thestore,"  Penny said as she laid the two bags offood on the kitchen counter.  "She said for me togo along without her.  Said she should be alonglater, but looking at the way everyone wasrunning around the Office Bin, I doubt it."            "So I guess its just the three of us then."Rachel noted as she helped Penny empty the bags."And as usual you’ve brought enough food tofeed a half dozen."           "Well I just like to give everyone a goodvariety,"  Penny laughed.  "Besides, my Uncle wasjust going to have to toss it all if I didn’t take it."            "And some of us can eat like a horse andstill look like a sparrow."  Stephanie said from thecouch with a bit of envy in her voice.           "Oh hi, Stef,"  Penny said as she peeled offher brown leather bomber jacket.  "I didn’t seeyou at first."           "Story of my life."  Stephanie laughed asthey exchanged a brief hug.           True to her sometimes tomboy image,Penny was wearing jeans, sneakers and a shortsleeved corduroy shirt.  Stephanie wished shecould dress for work like that. Penny’s hair lookedlike it was cut even shorter than the last time she’dseen her.  Most woman couldn’t get away withhair like that, but on the short girl it certainlyworked.           "So what’s on the agenda for tonight?"  asked Penny.           "Well I guess some good food, a little wineand whatever’s on the TV."  Rachel replied. "With weather like this I think club hoppings outfor tonight.  So its just us girls."            "Unless you have a guy or two in thosebags."  Stephanie quipped.             Penny made a show of checking the twoempty shopping bags, then looked at her friendswith a disappointing look.            "I knew I forgot something,"  she laughed. "And Willoughby’s was running a special on cuteyoung guys tonight, too."            All three of them laughed at the joke asthey made up plates from the food Penny hadbrought.  Rachel took a cold bottle from therefrigerator and poured them each a glass of wineto go with the dinner.                Conversation over dinner made the mealthat much more enjoyable.  They had just aboutfinished when Stephanie noticed the last ofPenny’s packages still on the floor.             "So what’s with the other bag?" Stephanie asked as she ate.             "Oh I almost forgot,"  Penny replied withexcitement.  "Let me get it."        Dropping the bag on the center of thecountertop, Penny peeled it away to reveal a smallstatuette.  It was a semi-nude woman riding ahorse.  She was clad in battle armor and held asword and shield.  Engraved on the base was thetitle of the piece - Valkerie.         "It’s just a little apartment warming gift." Penny explained.  "When I saw it in the Sci Fi andFantasy shop I just fell in love with it."        "It’s beautiful,"  Rachel exclaimed.  "Iknow just the place for it."        With that, she picked it up and carried itover to the entertainment center.  A moment laterit occupied  a place of honor on it.        "Guess we should see what’s on the tube." Stephanie said, feeling a little bad that she hadn’tbrought a gift too.            "Might as well."  Rachel said as shepicked up the cable remote.  "Bring the wine inwith you."            As the girls settled in, each on their ownsection of the couch, Rachel tossed the remote toPenny who had sat to her right.            "Since you brought such a lovely gift, youget to pick what we watch."  she said.        "All right!"  Penny yelled.  "The ultimatepower -- control of the remote."                It quickly became apparent that even withover 80 channels, there wasn’t a great deal towatch -- at least not tonight.  Penny started withall the prime movie channels, HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, all showing films they had seen before.Next she tried some of the oldies channels, someof those classics were pretty good.  But theystruck out there as well.        "It helps if you stop at a channel for morethan 30 seconds."  Stephanie suggested with asmile.        "Okay rocket scientist, lets see you dobetter."  Penny grinned back as she tossed theremote across the couch.                "The secret,"  Stephanie said as sheclicked on the channel up button.  "Is not torandomly jump around the dial but to start at thebottom and work your way up."        Channel by channel flashed by -- akaleidoscope of entertainment ranging frommovies to game shows, how to shows to cookinghelp.        "This is entertaining,"  Penny said. "Maybewe should try a board game instead or maybe..."        The short black haired girl stopped inmid-sentence, her attention grabbed by the imagethat had just appeared on the large screen.        "Now that’s what I call entertainment!!" Penny cried out, pointing to the screen.        "Omigod, Rachel!"  Stephanie gasped asshe turned from the screen to her friend. "Whatare you doing with the porno channel?"        "Who cares?"  Penny interrupted.  "I likethis."        "Its not what you think,"  Rachel said.  "Ionly ordered basic cable.  Who has the money topay for all those premium channels?"        "And they all just appeared one day onyour TV,"  Stephanie laughed. "Like magic."        "Actually,..."  Stephanie hesitated for amoment.  "When the cable guy hooked this all up,he asked if I wanted all the stations."        "Yeah, right, you just smiled at him and hegave you all this."  Stephanie mocked with asmile.        "All right, he also asked me to dinner." she admitted.        "I bet I know what you had."  Penny laughed as she opened her mouth and slid herhand back and forth in front of it, as if she wereperforming oral sex.        "You know better than that, Penny." Rachel said in a sharp rebuke.        "Oh that’s right, I forgot."  the 20 year oldlied.  "You don’t do things like that."                Truth was, Rachel actually didn’t.  In theeight years of her sexual life, she’d performed oralsex on a guy a total of only two times.  Thesecond had only been to confirm the conclusionshe’d come to after the first:  namely that it wasn’tsomething she ever wanted to do again.         It didn’t make her a prude by any means,she was far from it.  When Rachel finally warmedup to a man enough to want him in her bed, shewas every guys dream: a woman who was warmand supportive in public -- and a wanton whore inthe bedroom.  The only problem was that mostguys didn’t make it to that level with her.  Mostusually lost interest when they learned she didn’tsuck cock.  The cute cable guy had been one ofthem.          "Maybe Rachel doesn’t,"  Stephanie noted,her eyes glued to the television.  "But that girlcertainly does."        The wide 35 inch screen was now filledwith the image of a large breasted blonde whowas giving quite a demonstration in the art offellatio.  The young man’s cock she hadswallowed practically whole was also quiteimpressive.        "She is good at it,"  Penny laughed.  "Maybe you should take notes, Rachel        Rachel made a disapproving face.        "Yeah, like that guys really that big!  I’llbet that’s as fake as that bimbo’s tits."        "Looks pretty real to me."  Penny said.        "Special effects,"  Rachel suggested. "Youcan’t tell me you’ve ever seen a guy that big forreal."        "I have ... "  Stephanie started to saywithout thinking, then caught herself."        It was a momentary slip of the tongue, buteach of the other girls caught it immediately.        "Tell, tell."  they both called out.  "Truthor Dare.  You know the rules."        It was a game they had played amongthemselves, a game of sexual secrets.  If any ofthem admitted to a sexual secret, they had to tellor take a dare.  The dares had sometimes been farworse than the truth.           "Come on Stef,"  Penny encouraged. "Truth or Dare?" she added with wicked emphasison the second choice."         Stephanie considered the possibleconsequences of a dare for a brief moment, thendecided on the truth.        "Robby McPherson."  she answered in alow voice.        "What was that?"  Rachel asked, cuppingher hand around her ear as if she was hard ofhearing.        "Robby McPherson!"  Stephanie repeatedin a louder voice.        "Robby McPherson!"  Penny also repeatedin an even louder voice.        "That computer geek who worked at themall last summer,"  Rachel chimed in. "ThatRobby McPherson?"               "Yes."  Stephanie responded simply.        "What the hell where you thinking?" Rachel asked.        "I can’t believe you dated that loser." Penny added when Stephanie didn’t reply.        "He was not a loser!"  Stephanie snappedback.  "And I didn’t date him ...  I fucked him! There I said it, are you happy." she added, takinga large drink from her wine glass.           "Shit, Stef, that’s even worse."  Rachelsaid.  "Why would you do a thing like that?"        In reply, Stephanie held up both hands andbrought them together until they stopped aboutnine inches apart.  Her meaning was obvious toher friends.  It was a gesture they’d use inreference to guys many times.  The only differencewas that this time it wasn’t a diminutive allusion.        "You’re shitting me."  Rachel said, eyeingthe gap between her hands.        "Honest truth."  Stephanie said, a termnone of them would ever lie about.        "Fuck!"  Rachel exclaimed.  "Who’d haveever thought it."                "Wait a minute,"  Penny cut them off. "Not so fast."        Stephanie and Rachel both turned to theirgirlfriend.        "Look, I’m willing to accept that maybeRobby McPherson, jerk that he might have been,is hung like a horse. And I’ll even admit that giventhe chance, anyone of us would’ve fucked himtoo.  But there is no way that you could’ve knownthat before you hopped into bed with him!"        "Actually, it was the back seat of his Dad’scar."  Stephanie grinned.  "And I did know, mybrother Jerry told me."        Both girls remembered Jerry Morgan hadalso worked at the mall last summer.  In fact, hehad been one of the few people who had beenfriends with Robby.        "How would Jerry know how big he was?" Rachel asked.  "And why would he tell you?"        "The same way I know Judy Peterman hasa large birthmark mole on her ass: the locker roomshowers."  Stephanie said.  "And as to the why, Iasked him once out of idle curiosity who had thebiggest cock in the mall."        "I still don’t buy it,"  Penny said.  "If mybrother asked me which girl in the shower had thebest boobs, I can’t imagine answering him.  And Idefinitely can’t imagine me asking him to checkout cocks for me -- or have him actually do it if Idid."                   "Well, maybe he would,"  Stephanieanswered with a devious smile on her face.  "Ifyou’d gotten him laid."        "You got him laid?"  Penny asked indisbelief.        "Well he thinks I got him laid," Stephanieadmitted.  "Actually all I did was introduce him toGloria Nelson."        "You got him laid," Rachel stated withauthority.  "All you had to do was introduce himto that teencock hungry bitch."                Gloria Nelson was a 37 year-old assistantmanager at the Oakdale Mall.  Twice divorced, itwas no secret among most of the women whoworked there that the redhead had a weakness forbarely legal boys.  Her various sexual escapadeswould have been enough to get her fired, if not forthe fact that her family was one of the mostprominent in town.          Unless one of her conquests turned out tobe underage -- she was always very careful aboutthat -- or one of the young men filed a complaint,even more unlikely after she had freely given themwhat they all would agree was one hot piece ofass -- Gloria would continue with her littleappetites.             "I guess that would be enough to get himto check out some cocks for you."  Penny finallyadmitted.         "To be honest, since that’s the nature ofthe game,"  Stephanie mused,  "I think most guys,Jerry included, do check the others out, to seehow they compare with each other.  They justdon’t want to admit they look at other guys."        "That’s probably true." both girls agreed,remembering secretly checking out classmates inthe showers back when they all started to develop.         "Now can we forget about all this andwatch the movie or something?"  Stephanie asked.            "Okay,"  Penny agreed.  "But I’m still madat you for one thing."        "What’s that?"  Stephanie asked somewhatconfused.        "You knew that twerp had a 9-inch cockand you didn’t tell any of the rest of us!"        All three of them burst into laughter asRachel refilled all their glasses.            For the next three quarters of an hour, thegirls watched the adult film, offering jokes andcomments about what they saw.  Also during thattime they finished off the first bottle of wine andworked their way halfway through a second.Rachel had also thrown a bag of popcorn into themicrowave. After all, what fun was a moviewithout popcorn?         The plot of the movie, such as there wasof one, was that of an adult television station trying to pick its new fall line-up.  A mixture ofmen and women sat in a boardroom, watchingshort clips of various pilots.  It was one such showthat the girls had already watched.  The clips wereshort on plot but long on sex.  As they went on,the members of the selection committee becamemore and more aroused.  A condition each of thegirls could sympathize with, even if they didn’twant to admit it.         The appearance of a small Asian womanon the screen brought immediate comments fromRachel and Stephanie that she resembled Penny, though in fact the multicultrual girl was differenteverywhere beyond Asian features and similarheight.        "I don’t look like that,"  Penny declared inmock protest, adding with a laugh,  "I have muchnicer tits."          It didn’t take long for the Asian actress tobecome involved with her male co-star.  In fact, ittook less than two minutes for these supposedlytotal strangers to get naked and go at it.  As theydid, Penny’s friends continued to remark at howmuch the girl on the screen really looked like her.        "I don’t know Penny,"  Stephanie musedas she watched the actress deep throat the manwho was as generously endowed as the actor inthe first clip.  "We’ve double dated and I have tosay, that sure looks like you."         "Yeah, are you sure you haven’t beenmoonlighting?"  Rachel chimed in.        "Why?"  Penny laughed.  "Are youjealous?"        Their friendly barbs continued as theon-screen couple continued their endeavors.  Theman climbed behind the girl and positioned hiscock against her ass.  With a loud grunt, hepushed his manhood inside her, accompanied bysqueals of encouragement from his partner.        "Ouch!"  Stephanie cried.  "That’s got tohurt!"        "Well, that proves that’s not me."  Pennygrimaced.  ‘This little ass is much too tight forsomething that big."  she quipped as she pattedher bottom.        "I don’t know,"  Rachel mused.  "I’veheard that if it’s done right it can be quite fun. After all, isn’t that what gay guys do?  There hasto be something pleasurable about it."        "Well when you find out, you can let therest of us know."  Stephanie retorted, wonderingif perhaps her friend had already tried it and didn’twant to admit it.                Another scene change brought an olderwoman in her forties to the screen, already ridingatop a young man who couldn’t be far out of histeens.  Almost immediately all three of them calledout the name of Gloria Nelson.  The fact that thiswoman was a brunette instead of a redheadmattered little.          "I guess that makes that your brother Jerrylaying underneath her."  Penny offered.        "No way,"  Stephanie retorted.  "Mybrother has a much better bod."        As one, Penny and Rachel snapped theirheads around to look in astonishment.        "Oh come on, you both have brothers." Stephanie added tartly. "You can’t tell me thatsomewhere along the line you haven’t gotten apeek at them, just like I’m sure they’ve gotten apeek at you."        Silence gave truth to her assertion.  It wasobvious that the wine, and the movie, were muchresponsible for her frankness.           Back on the screen, the Gloria Nelsonsurrogate was riding the younger man like a rodeorider atop a bull.  Her large unrestrained breastsbouncing in all directions.  The look of ecstasy onher face was a powerful enticement to the joys ofteenage boys.                "What do you think will happen first?" Penny asked.  "He pops his cork or that bedcollapses beneath them?"            "I’d say 50 - 50 either way."  Rachelanswered.        "I’ll go with his popping his cork," Stephanie bet. "That bed is stronger than it looks."        Less than an minute later, Stephanie wonthe bet as "Gloria" suddenly jumped off the youngman and spun around on the bed, her hand neverreleasing it’s grip on his hard cock.  Soon as thebrunette’s face reached his boyhood, it explodedin a shower of hot whiteness, covering her eagerlips and cheeks with his eruption.                The preview faded from view, to bereplaced by another scene.  It looked like thelocker room of the local high school.  From offcamera, the sound of running water could beheard from the showers.        "Anyone care to guess what kind of scenethis one is going to be?"  Penny asked, turning themovie into a sort of guessing game.        "My guess is the Quarterback andCheerleader."  Rachel said as she tossed half ahandful of popcorn into her mouth.        "Teacher and Student’s my guess." Stephanie said.        "I’m going to go with a gang bang." Penny offered with a wicked grin.        The Asian girl won that round as the starof the little epic, a tall statuesque blonde dressedin a very tight white uniform came into the lockerroom.  Evidently she was supposed to be theschool nurse.  She acted surprised when the soundof running water ceased and a half dozen nakedhunks walked into view.          In no time at all, the busty blonde waslaying on one of the benches, a stiff member ineach of her hands, a hard one in her mouth, afourth and fifth in her shaved pussy and tight ass. Standing just off to the right of the after-schoolorgy was the best looking of all the guys, playfullystroking the largest cock of the group and waitingfor an opening he could put it into.            "Guess she never heard of the idea thatyou can have too much of a good thing."  Rachelcommented.        "Maybe,"  Penny said.  "But I’d be glad totake care of the odd man out there."        "Get in line girl."  Stephanie cut in.                For so energetic a scene, it turned out tobe surprisingly short.  The odd man out never didfind his hole, but joined in with his buddies ingiving the nurse a cum shower.        "Well, so much for the idea that more isbetter."  Rachel said.        "Yeah, I think I prefer my sex one onone,"  Stephanie added.        "Me too,"  Penny chimed in.  "Well, maybetwo on one, but no more than that.  Except maybeon special occasions of course."                Rachel and Stephanie both laughed, notsure how much of Penny’s statement was intendedas a joke.         The scene shifted back to the boardroomwere several of the network executives were nowin various stages of undress, already engaged in sexual acts.  One of the female executives, a darkhaired thirty year old, was spread across the table,her dress up around her waist, her legs spreadwide.  Buried between those legs was the face of amale executive.  Kneeing beside that man was oneof the secretaries, her own mouth wrapped tightlyaround the cock sticking out from his threehundred dollar suit.          At the head of the table, the silver-grayhaired chairman of the board was also missing thelower half of his high priced suit, his own cockhowever was not as visible.  Instead it was buriedin the red-haired mound of the second secretarywho was being mounted doggie style by the seniorexecutive.          At the head of the room, the narrator ofthe film, who had also introducing the TV pilots,was trying to ignore the spectacle before him. Hecontinued to tell about the last show on theagenda.  It began to run on the monitor as thenarrator threw up his hand in surrender and pulledout his cock, sliding it into the mouth of theredhead.         The boardroom image faded, replaced bythe kitchen of a small apartment.  Standing at thecounter, her back to the camera, was a youngHispanic woman in her twenties.  Wearing a pairof cut off shorts and a red and white striped tanktop, she was pouring herself a cup of coffee.  Asshe turned to face the camera, a second cup became visible on the counter.  A smile crossed herlips as she tasted the steaming liquid.        Another figure then entered the kitchen, alight skinned brunette wearing a blue bathrobe.Her tousled short hair gave added evidence thatshe had just gotten out of bed. Pushing a lock ofloose hair away from her eyes, she accepted thesecond cup of coffee. In a brief chat the newarrival's name was revealed as Donna and thecoffee maker's as Modesta.         In no time at all, Donna’s robe fell opened,revealing a soft body accented by small curvingmounds, the pink nipples of which were both hardand visible.  The cup at her lips was quicklyreplaced by the equally hot lips of her companion.         With dazzling speed, the darker skinnedgirl traced a wet path down from the brunettes lipsto her breast. The nipple of which quicklydisappeared between her lips.         "Oh my!"  Stephanie gasped as shewatched the onscreen encounter advance to thenext stage.  She had crossed the room to pick upsome more muchies, but had stopped in mid stepat the sight.          In no time at all, Modesta's attentiondropped below her companion’s waist.  Stephaniehad seen women kiss each other on a few daringtelevision shows, had even seen them caress eachother’s breasts in an R rated film, but never hadshe seen a woman performing oral sex on anotherwoman.        The camera zoomed in, giving a close upview of Modesta’s tongue darting up and into thepink recesses of Donna’s pussy.  The picture wasso vivid that Stephanie could see the shiny layer ofnectar Modesta’s ministrations had produced.        ‘God, could you ever imagine doingsomething like that?"  Stephanie asked, her eyesnever leaving the screen.                It took a few long seconds for her torealize her friends hadn’t answered -- which shefound unusual.  She couldn’t ever remember thembeing at a loss for words!        "Could you ever imagine doing anythinglike that?"  she repeated, assuming they hadn’theard her.                The continued silence finally broke herfixation on the screen.  She turned her attentionback to Rachel.  The look on her girlfriend’s facewas akin to that of a kid who’d been caught witha hand in the cookie jar.                       "You’re kidding!"  Stephanie declared.        "Well, if you can be honest about RobbyMcPherson, then I should be honest too."  Rachel admitted.        "I don’t believe it,"  Stephanie said.  "Ithink now you’re putting me on.  Who have youever done it with?"                Rachel took a moment to think about heranswer.  Stephanie expected Rachel to say somedistant friend, if anything.  Instead the brunettelooked past the blond to the other end of the     couch.        Stephanie followed her line of sight, untilit stopped on an equally guilty face.        "Oh no, you had me going for a moment," Stephanie said, a touch of amusement in her tone."But now you’re stretching this a bit too far  --just a little bit over the top.  That was almost asgood as that story you had me believing aboutTracy Conway last month.                Tracy Conway was a somewhat masculinewoman in her thirties who also worked in the Mallat a sporting goods store.  One night, following afew hours of bar-hopping, the other girls hadconvinced Stephanie that Tracy was female as theresult of  a sex change operation.  It tookStephanie a week to discover it had been a joke.          Stephanie looked again at both of herfriends.  Neither one of them were laughing thistime.  Instead they shared a silent communication.        Without a word Penny got up from thecouch and walked past Stephanie. When shereached Rachel, the young Asian woman reachedup and gently stroked her cheek.  Then she pulledthe taller woman down to her level and kissed heron the lips.          It was a soft kiss at first, the kind that onefriend might give another, no different than someStephanie herself had gotten.  Then it becamemore and more erotic, a melding of lips and eagertongues.  Rachel responded in turn, pressing hardagainst the younger girl.        Stephanie was still trying to decide if thiswas a gag when Penny pushed the game evenfurther.  She slipped her hand up under Rachel’sT-shirt and fondled the naked flesh beneath it.         Breaking the kiss, she pulled up the thinmaterial and planted kisses on Rachel’s nowexposed breasts as well. Mimicking Modesta’sactions on the cable station, Penny slid her tongueunder Rachel’s erect nipple and guided it into hermouth.               "Shit,"  Stephanie finally exclaimed in arush of air. "This isn’t a joke."        With that, the two lovers ended theirembrace and faced their friend.  Their faces nowreflected a look of expectation.                Glancing back at the TV image, Stephanienoted that the two woman were now locked in a69 position, their mouths pressed tightly in eachother’s wet mounds.  What truly startled her wasthat, in her mind, instead of Donna and Modesta,the forms she now saw pressed together werethose of Rachel and Penny.                "Is it really as much fun as it looks?"  shewondered out loud.        In reply, she felt a soft hand come to reston her shoulder.           "We’d be happy to show you if you’rereally interested."  Rachel said.  "The only reasonwe never asked before is we weren’t sure of howyou’d react."        "Then why did you tell me now?" Stephanie asked.        "Honestly, I’m not sure,"  Stephanielaughed softly, trying to break the underlyingtension. "I didn’t plan it this way, it just seemedthe perfect time."        Stephanie thought about it for a briefmoment and decided that events had indeed madethis the perfect time.  The wine, the conversationthey’d been having had put them all at ease withwhat would normally have been a very awkwardsubject.        "And if  I thought that this wasn’t the sortof thing for me?"  Stephanie asked.        "Then I hope we’d just forget it all andstill be the same friends we all were 10 minutesago." Rachel replied.              Stephanie again looked past Rachel toPenny.  The younger girl hadn’t said a single wordsince Stephanie’s revelation.  She didn’t have to.The look in her eyes and on her face was amixture of apprehension and lust.        "Well I’ve always said,"  Stephanie said,placing her hand atop Rachel’s.  "You should tryeverything in life -- at least once."          She shifted her body ever so slightly, justenough to bring herself face to face with Rachel. Leaning forward, she pressed her lips against her.                It wasn’t the first time she had ever kissedRachel.  There had been many occasions when shekissed other girls, but never like this.  The touchof their lips now seemed electric.  A warmthspread throughout their bodies from that briefcontact.  The kiss was at the same time both briefand endless.          Still unsure of the situation, Rachel letStephanie take the lead.  It wasn’t until the blondkissed her a second time that Rachel began torespond.        Stephanie closed her eyes and the passionbuilding within her take control. She pushed hertongue into Rachel’s mouth, exploring thesoftness of it’s mirror image.        Rachel took hold of Stephanie’s hands andpressed them against her breasts. Tentatively, sheexplored the material covered mounds.  It was thefirst time she had ever felt the softness of aanother woman’s breast, the hardness of erectnipples.        As Stephanie continued to explore herfriends body, Rachel slid her own hands up anddown her friend’s back.  She took hold of thezipper of her dress and pulled it down, exposingthe flesh beneath it.  She caressed that flesh,running her nails across it.                The touch of a new hand caused Stephanieto open her eyes.  Penny now stood next to her aswell, a wide smile on her face.  Stephanie shiftedher attention to the youngest of her friends andkissed her too.  A kiss equal in intensity to thatshe had just given Rachel.  To Stephanie’s delight,the reaction she felt to it was also the same.        The three young women stood interlockedin the center of the room, kissing, exploring eachothers bodies, loosening clothing and searchingout the flesh beneath it.        "Maybe we should all just take a minuteand get comfortable."  Rachel suggestion.         The other’s nodded their agreement, andthey all took a few steps back from each other. Rachel was wearing the least so it took her only afew seconds to drop her shirt and panties to thefloor.  Standing naked in the center of the roomfor the second time that night, she took a momentto shut off the television. There was no longer anyneed for it, not when a much more interestingentertainment was about to commence.        Penny and Stephanie took only a littlelonger.  A small pile of clothes rested at eachgirl’s feet, topped by undergarments of variousdesigns.  Now they all stood naked, looking ateach other during an awkward pause.        Only a short time before, Stephanie hadfelt a little strange looking at Rachel’s nakedbody. Now she looked with a different eye.  All ofthem took a moment to look at each other.         Stephanie was surprised to see that Pennyhad shaved the hair between her legs.  She knewfrom brief glimpses that there never had beenmuch there to begin with.  But the absence of thatlittle bit made the small girl seem even more like ateenager. Rachel on the other hand, had a widepatch of dark brown hair.  Stephanie’s own bushwas somewhere between the two extremes and alight blond.        Even their breasts formed a sharp contrast, not just in size, ranging from Rachel’s 38C toPenny’s 34B, but in the very shape of them. Stephanie’s were very rounded with wide pinkcircles around short pink nipples.  Rachel’smounds were conical in nature with puffy areolasthat stuck out even further.  Penny had the darkestnipples of the three, a rich dark brown againstbutternut skin.                  "So now what?"  Stephanie asked as shetossed her hands up in the air.        "Why don’t you make yourselfcomfortable on the couch," Rachel suggested witha smile.  "and let us take care of getting thingsstarted."        Thinking it not a bad suggestion at all,Stephanie sat down on the center of the widecouch.  Rachel and Penny sat down beside her,tossing the larger throw pillows onto thehardwood floor.  They would come in handy later.        Penny kissed Stephanie.  Then Rachelkissed Stephanie.  Then, leaning across the middlegirl, Penny kissed Rachel.  As they did, they eachcupped the closest of Stephanie’s breasts, playingtheir fingers across her nipples - enjoying thestiffness found there.        Stephanie couldn’t help but compare thetouch of the two women to that of men she’dknown.  For the most part, it was softer -- yet atthe same time much more erotic.  As were the sensations it produced.  Even more pleasing werethe waves of delight that filled her breasts whenthose skillful fingers where replaced with evenmore talented mouths.         Matching tongues traced a path acrosssupple flesh, until they met in the rich valleybetween the mounds.  There the two lovers kissedonce more before parting in different directions.         Penny continued to kiss and caressStephanie’s breasts, alternating between softtouches and gentle bites.  Working her way backto Stephanie’s willing mouth, she pressed herdarker breasts hard against the those of the girlbeneath her. The nipple to nipple contact wasenough to elicit a soft moan from Stephanie.  Amoan cut short by the crush of Penny’s mouth.        Rachel had moved her attentions lower,dropping down to sit on one of the oversizedcushions.  With a hand on each of Stef’s thighs,she spread them apart to expose the blond-framedpearl.        Burying her head between the pale legs,Rachel ran her tongue along the length of herfriend’s womanhood -- her heart racing withexcitement at the idea that she was the firstwoman ever to do so.  The scent of Stephanie’salready damp mound was intoxicating, a feastwaiting to be savored.         Not to be denied, she drove her tongue upbetween the folds of those sugar walls, clearing apath to the clitoris.  A path quickly followed.        "Oh God!!"  Stephanie gasped as she feltRachel’s tongue strike her like the spark to amatch.  It was enough for her to momentaryforget the girl still playing with both her breastsand mouth.          But only for a moment as Penny liftedherself higher and guided one of her own richmounds to Stephanie’s lips.  Her mouth still openfrom her gasp, Penny pushed her erect nipplebetween the blonde’s red lips.        There had often been times whenStephanie had often wondered what it might feellike to suck on a woman’s breasts.  Her ownmounds were too small to try it on herself.  She’dincluded sucking on a man’s nipples as part of herloveplay, but she was sure it wasn’t the same.        Now with the reality between her teeth,she knew that her earlier conclusion was right. Playing with a man’s nipples was nothing like thereal thing of a woman.  She could taste Penny in away that she never could a man, delighting in themixture of soft and hard.  She ran her tongue backand forth across the dark, pert tips, trying torepeat the pleasing affect that Penny had producedin her.           As the now saturated nipple slipped fromher lips, Penny wrapped her hands around theback of Stephanie’s head, guiding her face to thesoft spot between her breasts, inviting her to feastthere as well, an invitation Stephanie was all toowilling to accept.  She licked her way across thedamp skin, enjoying the heady aroma filling hernostrils. Then with girlish delight she repeated herperformance on Penny’s other mound.        Her interest still fixed on Stephanie’spussy, Rachel slid one finger, then another deepwithin it.  The initial wetness she found there increased as she moved her fingers back and forth. With their motion waves of enchantmentexpanded to fill Stephanie’s relaxed form.        Rachel augmented the touch of her fingerswith that of her tongue, reaching her friend’s mostsensitive spots as if they were familiar as her own. In truth many of them were identical.          If Stephanie had time to think about it --which her two friends were definitely not allowing-- she might have appreciated the irony of thesituation.  Rachel, who cringed at the thought oftaking a man in her mouth, had no such hesitationwhere another woman was involved.        "This feels so fucking good!"  Stephaniemoaned as she laid back and enjoyed thetwo-pronged assault on her body.  "I don’t thinkI’ve ever felt this fantastic."         As Penny climbed off Stephanie, Rachelalso moved back.  Together they guided theirneophyte lover onto the large pillows they hadearlier tossed to the floor.  As soon as Stephanielaid across the pillows, Rachel again spread herlegs and went right back to where she left off.        Penny had other ideas.  It was timeStephanie learned how to give as well as receive.Squatting over Stephanie’s face, Penny droppeddown until her pussy was only a few inches aboveit.        Prior to this moment, Stephanie had neverseen another woman’s sex close up.  The fact thatPenny’s was totally hairless gave it an even moreinteresting perspective.  The first thing she noticedwas that for such a small girl, Penny had anunusually large clitoris. It was almost like a tinypenis.         No imagination was needed for Stephanieto figure out what Penny wanted. Unlike Rachel,Stephanie never had a problem with oral sex, sowith virginal enthusiasm, she reached out with hertongue and ran it across Penny’s erect clit.        "Oh yeah baby,"  Penny panted.  "Go forit!"        Go for it Stephanie did, pulling Penny’sclit between her lips, massaging it with hertongue.  Then she swept it back across the lengthof Penny’s pussy, savoring her first taste of awoman.          The scent of Penny's sex was almostoverpowering, and to her delight she learned withher first lick that the taste was all she hoped itwould be.  Penny lowered her pelvis further sothat Stephanie could have easier access to her wetcunt.          Slowly at first, Stephanie licked theyounger girl, exploring her womanhood.  Thenshe began to quicken the pace until she reached arhythm that sent little ripples throughout Penny'sbody.          Ripples that mirrored those fillingStephanie's body as Rachel continued to workmagic between her legs.  As one hand continuedto slide outstretched fingers up and down theblond framed love canal, the brunette’s other handworked the same enchantment on her own -- withmuch the same results.        Faster and faster all three of them went,plunging down the well of ecstasy.  It was a raceto rapture - a pursuit each wanted to win.          To her surprise, Stephanie produced thefirst orgasm as Penny’s body suddenly convulsedagainst her mouth and it filled with a blast ofhoney.  It was such a sexual rush that it sentStephanie’s own body over the edge, showering Rachel with the same gift.  A reward she hungrilyaccepted.        Finally, Rachel joined the chorus, meremoments behind the others, propelled by thesymphony of her fingers                  "Oh my god!"  Stephanie exclaimed asthey laid naked on the floor, still entwined in eachother’s bodies.  "I can’t believe how intense thatwas.  How did you ever get the idea to trysomething like this ... and how long have you beendoing it?"                "Well it was originally Penny’s idea." Rachel replied, running her hand alongsidePenny’s cheek.  "And we’ve been doing it, as youcall it, for the last six months."        Stephanie turned to Penny, but before shecould ask the question on her lips, Pennyanswered it with a laugh.        "I’ve been doing it since I was 16. Whatcan I say?  I’ve always been an advanced learner."                 The other two girls joined in the laughteras they continued to stroke and kiss each other. They all knew what had just happened was onlythe beginning.  There would be many more littleadventures in their collective future.                "Err ... Rachel,"  Stephanie suddenly askedseriously.  "Remember what you said earliertonight about the nameplate on the door?"        "Of course,"  Rachel answered, wonderingwhy Stephanie was suddenly concerned aboutsomething so mundane.        "I think you might want to try andremember that a little harder in the future." Stephanie continued.                "Oh shit!" Penny cried out abruptly, cutting off any further inquiry Rachel might havehad about Stephanie’s sudden tangent.                Rachel followed Penny’s gaze until allthree of them were looking at the front doorway. An entrance now filled by the tall figure of a darkskinned young woman in a bright red raincoat,holding a silver keychain in her hand.                "Fuck!"  Rachel blurted out," "Pamela!"        They all sat silent after that for longseconds,  like statues in some far off garden.                "Looks like I missed one hell of a party." Pamela said as she pulled off her raincoat anddraped it over a wall hook, revealing a bluebusiness suit.  "And here I thought I knew whatkind of people my friends were." she said in a hurttone.                 "Oh fuck!"  Rachel repeated.  The othertwo girls were still too stunned to say anythingelse.                "I am disappointed in you all,"  Pameladeclared as she stepped into the room and stoodover the naked trio.  "I thought we were supposedto be the Four Musketeers!"                It took a few seconds for them to realizethat the oldest of their little group wasn’t reallyangry or shocked at all. In fact, it was nowbecoming obvious that she hadn’t just walked ineither. How long she’d been watching was anquestion unasked -- at least for now.          With smiles now filling their faces, allthree girls reached up and pulled Pamela downinto the center of their circle.  She seemed a littleout of place with her conservative attire, butwithin a few minutes that was gone as well.  Herdark form was soon covered by an intermix oflighter hues.                Hours later, long after the rain hadstopped and the night once more grew quiet, thesounds of passion could still be heard.  Thequartet truly learned the meaning of their motto. One for all, and all for one.    END #*#One For AllOne For All ...by Ann Douglas#*#        Stepping into the building vestibule,Stephanie Morgan shook the water from herumbrella. It had only been a little over two blockwalk from the bus stop, but she had gotten soakednevertheless. Opening her raincoat, the 24 yearold blond made an attempt to shake that dry aswell.        It had been bad luck that her brotherJerry’s car had picked tonight of all nights not tostart up.  He had promised to drop her off at herfriend Rachel’s new apartment. No matter, shereluctantly concluded, at least she was here now.        "Lets see,"  she mused as she ran herfinger across the row of intercom buttons."Alexander ... Markham ... Ford ...  here it is,Lieberman, 5B"        It took a few moments to get a response,then a semi-distorted voice filtered through thespeaker.        "Hello?"  the female voice asked.        "Rachel, it’s me Stef."  she replied.        "Come on up," Rachel said as the buzzersounded and the inner door unlocked.  "I’m in theshower."          "She’s in the shower?"  Stephanie laughedas she glanced back out into the rain coveredstreet.         As she walked up the stairs to the fifthfloor apartment, Stephanie couldn’t help but envyher girlfriends new accommodations.  To someonestill living at home, the small apartment complexmight has well been a palace. There was no waythe salesgirl could afford a place like this on hersalary.          Of course Rachel really couldn’t afford aplace like this on her salary either.  The buildingwas owned by Martin Lieberman, who whenasked by his widowed sister-in-law to help herdaughter find an apartment was more than happyto find her this one.  It was a small thing to makea woman he’d admired for years happy.  Besides,having his niece living here assured him a honestpair of eyes to watch over his investment.         Reaching the fifth floor of the smallapartment building, Stephanie found that therewere some limits to Mr. Lieberman's generosityafter all.  Apartment 5B was a small studioapartment, one of three on the top floor.  Tryingthe door, she found it unlocked and steppedinside.        "Rachel," the blue eyed blond called out asshe closed the door behind her.        "I'm in here, Stef," came a reply from the bathroom, a voice much more recognizable thanthe one that had come over the intercom.  "Makeyourself comfortable and  I'll be out in a fewminutes."            Hanging her coat, on the rack by the door,Stephanie checked the short red dress she waswearing.  It was a little damp but otherwise okay.She had gotten home late and didn’t have time tochange clothes.          As she waited, Stephanie took in hersurroundings.  The apartment might be small, butit had a certain charm.  The first feature shenoticed were large twin skylights in the ceiling. The soft patter of rain could be heard againstthem.  On a clear day or night, they would give anice natural light to the room.        On the far left, a large bay window alsoadded to the natural light.  The view beyond itwas nothing special, but it was a nice feature.  A kitchenette over by the bathroom entranceconsisted of a small refrigerator, a stovetop and microwave. And of course a kitchen sink.        There really wasn't much in the way ofdecoration on the walls, but then Rachel had onlybeen living there a few weeks.  The center of theroom was dominated by a large green oversizedU-shaped sofa.  In addition to the deep cushions,it was covered with equally push and oversizedpillows.  Rachel had mentioned to her that sheused the sofa in place of a bed.        At the open end of the couch was one ofthose small self assembly entertainment centers, the bottom of  which was filled with her friend'sold stereo system . What was new was the large35-inch color television, a housewarming gift fromRachel's grandmother.  The couch had been onefrom her mother.        On both sides of the television were someframed photographs.  One brought a smile toStephanie’s face. The 5 x 7 picture was veryfamiliar to the 24 year old.  A smaller version wasstuck in the mirror frame in her own bedroom. The picture had been taken last summer at theOakdale Mall Talent Show.        Centered in the picture was Rachel ofcourse.  She always had to be the center ofattention.  To her right was Stephanie herself.That was when her hair had been down toher shoulders, rather than the short curly look shenow wore.        To Rachel's left was a much smaller girl,whose mixed Philippine, Chinese and Spanishheritage had given her a soft brown complexion. Her very short black hair and unisex featuresgave her an androgynous look.  In fact, if it wasn'tfor the small mounds protruding from her chest,she might've been mistaken for a teenage boy. Her name was Annie Liu, but everyone called herPenny.  Despite her teenage looks, she was 20years old.        The last member of the quartet was a tallblack woman standing just behind and to theleft of Rachel. Five foot ten, she stood half a headtaller than any of the others, more than that inthe case of Penny's five two. Her skin was ebonyblack, a sharp contrast to both Rachel andStephanie.  Most men first noticed her somewhatample bust.  In the case of women it was her jetblack hair which she usually wore in an elaboratedesign.  At 26, Pamela Wilson was the oldestmember of their little band.        All four women worked at the OakdaleMall. Rachel was a medical assistant.  Stephaniewas a sales representative at one of the large department stores.  Penny worked at her unclesrestaurant. She was also a college student. Pamela was the associate manager of  an officesupply store.        Despite their differences in ages andbackgrounds, they had all become friends overcountless shared lunches.  Soon their friendshipshad extended beyond work.  The picture hadcaptured one of the highlights of that friendship. Billing themselves as the Four Musketeers, sonamed because those were the only costumes theycould find, they had entered the talent showas a singing group.  It was more fun than hardwork and the money went to charity.  To theirsurprise, they finished in second place.  Since thenthey still jokingly referred to themselves as theFour Musketeers.        "We'd have gotten first,"  Stephaniethought as she replaced the picture on theentertainment center. "If we paraded around halfnaked like Judy Peterman.  The judges weremore impressed by her big nipples stickingthrough her blouse than her singing."        "Any sign of the rain letting up?"  Rachelasked as she walked out of the bathroom.        "No, it looks like tonight’s a totalwashout."  Stephanie replied as she turned aroundat the sound of her voice.        "A pity."  Rachel commented as shewalked over to Stephanie and kissed her on thecheek as a friendly hello.        Covered only by a large bath towel thatshe had wrapped around herself, Rachel walkedover to a large dresser that lined the far wall, stilldrying her hair as she walked.        "It really sucks that it had to rain tonight" Rachel said , pulling a pair of panties and anoversized T-shirt from the top drawer.  "I waslooking forward to that concert."        The original plan for the evening was for agirls night out.  One of their favorite local bandswas holding an open air concert in Marshall Park.They'd planned to take dinner a couple of blanketsand a few bottles of wine out to enjoy the music. Unfortunately Mother Nature had other ideas.  Sorather than let the night go to waste, they haddecided to have a girl's night in instead.        "Penny and Pamela are picking up thefood." Rachel said as she unwrapped the towelfrom around her and let it fall to the floor.  "I'mnot sure what they're getting, but knowing Pamelait's sure to be something interesting." she added asshe stood there nude as the day she was born.        "I guess so." Stephanie replied in anstrained tone.        Silly as she knew it was, Stephanie felt it alittle strange for her friend to be standing nude infront of her as they continued their conversation. It wasn't of course the first time she'd seen Rachelnaked.  They'd gone to the beach many times, aswell as clothes shopping both together and as partof the group.  They'd shared dressing rooms manytimes, but somehow it now seemed different --somewhat out of context maybe, standing nakedin the living room.  Then she reminded herself thatthis was also Rachel's bedroom, a place where itwas perfectly natural for her to be nude.        Stephanie also considered that she feltuncomfortable because when they'd first met,Rachel and she had almost the same physicalbuild, the main difference being Rachel's darkerbrown hair and slightly larger breasts.  Thatdifference had grown to more than a few poundsof extra weight on Stephanie. Despite assurancesfrom many of her friends that she looked betterwith the extra weight, which was still within thenorm for her size, she always felt self-consciousabout it. It was an outgrowth of her teen yearswhen she had actually been overweight.        It didn't take Rachel long to put on thepair of panties and the T-shirt she had taken out.Since she was home and not planning to go out,she didn't see the need for anything more.  Withher breasts still a little damp, Rachel's much darkernipples clearly showed through the thin cotton.        "Judy Peterman would’ve been  proud." Stephanie thought with a laugh as her discomfortpassed.        Fifteen minutes passed as the two of themsat on the couch and chatted. They had seeneach other that morning so it was more a matterof killing time until the others showed up thananything else.        "Oh by the way,"  Rachel said, "Remindme to give you keys to get in here before youleave. That way you can let yourself in the nexttime you come over. I've got one for Penny tooand I've already given one to Pamela."        "Okay,"  Stephanie answered.        "But be sure to check and make sure thatmy name shows in the peephole plate on thedoor."  Rachel grinned mischievously.  "Cause ifits blank, it means that I've got company and youshould definitely knock first."        Stephanie had to laugh at the warning.Although living at home didn't afford her theprivacy to use such a system, she'd heard about itfrom her cousin who used something like it atcollege.        The laughter was cut short by the sound ofthe intercom buzzer.  Rachel got up and pressedthe speaker button.        "Food delivery."  came the voice from thespeaker which both women recognized as Penny's.        In reply, Rachel reached up and hit thebutton that unlocked the front door.        "Come on up."  she said.                She then went and opened up theapartment door,  waiting for their friends to comeup.        "I wonder why Pamela didn't use her key?"she said.  "I hope she didn't loose it already.        The reason turned out to be even simpler.When Penny got to the top floor, Pamela wasn'twith her.        "I hope someone is going to give me ahand with this,"  the smaller girl called out as sheindicated the three shopping bags she wasburdened down with.  "These aren't exactly light."           Rachel grabbed the largest bag, surprisedby its weight.  It was obvious that it containedmore than take out food.            "Where’s Pamela?"  Rachel asked as sheled the shorter girl into the apartment.           "There was some sort of problem at thestore,"  Penny said as she laid the two bags offood on the kitchen counter.  "She said for me togo along without her.  Said she should be alonglater, but looking at the way everyone wasrunning around the Office Bin, I doubt it."            "So I guess its just the three of us then."Rachel noted as she helped Penny empty the bags."And as usual you’ve brought enough food tofeed a half dozen."           "Well I just like to give everyone a goodvariety,"  Penny laughed.  "Besides, my Uncle wasjust going to have to toss it all if I didn’t take it."            "And some of us can eat like a horse andstill look like a sparrow."  Stephanie said from thecouch with a bit of envy in her voice.           "Oh hi, Stef,"  Penny said as she peeled offher brown leather bomber jacket.  "I didn’t seeyou at first."           "Story of my life."  Stephanie laughed asthey exchanged a brief hug.           True to her sometimes tomboy image,Penny was wearing jeans, sneakers and a shortsleeved corduroy shirt.  Stephanie wished shecould dress for work like that. Penny’s hair lookedlike it was cut even shorter than the last time she’dseen her.  Most woman couldn’t get away withhair like that, but on the short girl it certainlyworked.           "So what’s on the agenda for tonight?"  asked Penny.           "Well I guess some good food, a little wineand whatever’s on the TV."  Rachel replied. "With weather like this I think club hoppings outfor tonight.  So its just us girls."            "Unless you have a guy or two in thosebags."  Stephanie quipped.             Penny made a show of checking the twoempty shopping bags, then looked at her friendswith a disappointing look.            "I knew I forgot something,"  she laughed. "And Willoughby’s was running a special on cuteyoung guys tonight, too."            All three of them laughed at the joke asthey made up plates from the food Penny hadbrought.  Rachel took a cold bottle from therefrigerator and poured them each a glass of wineto go with the dinner.                Conversation over dinner made the mealthat much more enjoyable.  They had just aboutfinished when Stephanie noticed the last ofPenny’s packages still on the floor.             "So what’s with the other bag?" Stephanie asked as she ate.             "Oh I almost forgot,"  Penny replied withexcitement.  "Let me get it."        Dropping the bag on the center of thecountertop, Penny peeled it away to reveal a smallstatuette.  It was a semi-nude woman riding ahorse.  She was clad in battle armor and held asword and shield.  Engraved on the base was thetitle of the piece - Valkerie.         "It’s just a little apartment warming gift." Penny explained.  "When I saw it in the Sci Fi andFantasy shop I just fell in love with it."        "It’s beautiful,"  Rachel exclaimed.  "Iknow just the place for it."        With that, she picked it up and carried itover to the entertainment center.  A moment laterit occupied  a place of honor on it.        "Guess we should see what’s on the tube." Stephanie said, feeling a little bad that she hadn’tbrought a gift too.            "Might as well."  Rachel said as shepicked up the cable remote.  "Bring the wine inwith you."            As the girls settled in, each on their ownsection of the couch, Rachel tossed the remote toPenny who had sat to her right.            "Since you brought such a lovely gift, youget to pick what we watch."  she said.        "All right!"  Penny yelled.  "The ultimatepower -- control of the remote."                It quickly became apparent that even withover 80 channels, there wasn’t a great deal towatch -- at least not tonight.  Penny started withall the prime movie channels, HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, all showing films they had seen before.Next she tried some of the oldies channels, someof those classics were pretty good.  But theystruck out there as well.        "It helps if you stop at a channel for morethan 30 seconds."  Stephanie suggested with asmile.        "Okay rocket scientist, lets see you dobetter."  Penny grinned back as she tossed theremote across the couch.                "The secret,"  Stephanie said as sheclicked on the channel up button.  "Is not torandomly jump around the dial but to start at thebottom and work your way up."        Channel by channel flashed by -- akaleidoscope of entertainment ranging frommovies to game shows, how to shows to cookinghelp.        "This is entertaining,"  Penny said. "Maybewe should try a board game instead or maybe..."        The short black haired girl stopped inmid-sentence, her attention grabbed by the imagethat had just appeared on the large screen.        "Now that’s what I call entertainment!!" Penny cried out, pointing to the screen.        "Omigod, Rachel!"  Stephanie gasped asshe turned from the screen to her friend. "Whatare you doing with the porno channel?"        "Who cares?"  Penny interrupted.  "I likethis."        "Its not what you think,"  Rachel said.  "Ionly ordered basic cable.  Who has the money topay for all those premium channels?"        "And they all just appeared one day onyour TV,"  Stephanie laughed. "Like magic."        "Actually,..."  Stephanie hesitated for amoment.  "When the cable guy hooked this all up,he asked if I wanted all the stations."        "Yeah, right, you just smiled at him and hegave you all this."  Stephanie mocked with asmile.        "All right, he also asked me to dinner." she admitted.        "I bet I know what you had."  Penny laughed as she opened her mouth and slid herhand back and forth in front of it, as if she wereperforming oral sex.        "You know better than that, Penny." Rachel said in a sharp rebuke.        "Oh that’s right, I forgot."  the 20 year oldlied.  "You don’t do things like that."                Truth was, Rachel actually didn’t.  In theeight years of her sexual life, she’d performed oralsex on a guy a total of only two times.  Thesecond had only been to confirm the conclusionshe’d come to after the first:  namely that it wasn’tsomething she ever wanted to do again.         It didn’t make her a prude by any means,she was far from it.  When Rachel finally warmedup to a man enough to want him in her bed, shewas every guys dream: a woman who was warmand supportive in public -- and a wanton whore inthe bedroom.  The only problem was that mostguys didn’t make it to that level with her.  Mostusually lost interest when they learned she didn’tsuck cock.  The cute cable guy had been one ofthem.          "Maybe Rachel doesn’t,"  Stephanie noted,her eyes glued to the television.  "But that girlcertainly does."        The wide 35 inch screen was now filledwith the image of a large breasted blonde whowas giving quite a demonstration in the art offellatio.  The young man’s cock she hadswallowed practically whole was also quiteimpressive.        "She is good at it,"  Penny laughed.  "Maybe you should take notes, Rachel        Rachel made a disapproving face.        "Yeah, like that guys really that big!  I’llbet that’s as fake as that bimbo’s tits."        "Looks pretty real to me."  Penny said.        "Special effects,"  Rachel suggested. "Youcan’t tell me you’ve ever seen a guy that big forreal."        "I have ... "  Stephanie started to saywithout thinking, then caught herself."        It was a momentary slip of the tongue, buteach of the other girls caught it immediately.        "Tell, tell."  they both called out.  "Truthor Dare.  You know the rules."        It was a game they had played amongthemselves, a game of sexual secrets.  If any ofthem admitted to a sexual secret, they had to tellor take a dare.  The dares had sometimes been farworse than the truth.           "Come on Stef,"  Penny encouraged. "Truth or Dare?" she added with wicked emphasison the second choice."         Stephanie considered the possibleconsequences of a dare for a brief moment, thendecided on the truth.        "Robby McPherson."  she answered in alow voice.        "What was that?"  Rachel asked, cuppingher hand around her ear as if she was hard ofhearing.        "Robby McPherson!"  Stephanie repeatedin a louder voice.        "Robby McPherson!"  Penny also repeatedin an even louder voice.        "That computer geek who worked at themall last summer,"  Rachel chimed in. "ThatRobby McPherson?"               "Yes."  Stephanie responded simply.        "What the hell where you thinking?" Rachel asked.        "I can’t believe you dated that loser." Penny added when Stephanie didn’t reply.        "He was not a loser!"  Stephanie snappedback.  "And I didn’t date him ...  I fucked him! There I said it, are you happy." she added, takinga large drink from her wine glass.           "Shit, Stef, that’s even worse."  Rachelsaid.  "Why would you do a thing like that?"        In reply, Stephanie held up both hands andbrought them together until they stopped aboutnine inches apart.  Her meaning was obvious toher friends.  It was a gesture they’d use inreference to guys many times.  The only differencewas that this time it wasn’t a diminutive allusion.        "You’re shitting me."  Rachel said, eyeingthe gap between her hands.        "Honest truth."  Stephanie said, a termnone of them would ever lie about.        "Fuck!"  Rachel exclaimed.  "Who’d haveever thought it."                "Wait a minute,"  Penny cut them off. "Not so fast."        Stephanie and Rachel both turned to theirgirlfriend.        "Look, I’m willing to accept that maybeRobby McPherson, jerk that he might have been,is hung like a horse. And I’ll even admit that giventhe chance, anyone of us would’ve fucked himtoo.  But there is no way that you could’ve knownthat before you hopped into bed with him!"        "Actually, it was the back seat of his Dad’scar."  Stephanie grinned.  "And I did know, mybrother Jerry told me."        Both girls remembered Jerry Morgan hadalso worked at the mall last summer.  In fact, hehad been one of the few people who had beenfriends with Robby.        "How would Jerry know how big he was?" Rachel asked.  "And why would he tell you?"        "The same way I know Judy Peterman hasa large birthmark mole on her ass: the locker roomshowers."  Stephanie said.  "And as to the why, Iasked him once out of idle curiosity who had thebiggest cock in the mall."        "I still don’t buy it,"  Penny said.  "If mybrother asked me which girl in the shower had thebest boobs, I can’t imagine answering him.  And Idefinitely can’t imagine me asking him to checkout cocks for me -- or have him actually do it if Idid."                   "Well, maybe he would,"  Stephanieanswered with a devious smile on her face.  "Ifyou’d gotten him laid."        "You got him laid?"  Penny asked indisbelief.        "Well he thinks I got him laid," Stephanieadmitted.  "Actually all I did was introduce him toGloria Nelson."        "You got him laid," Rachel stated withauthority.  "All you had to do was introduce himto that teencock hungry bitch."                Gloria Nelson was a 37 year-old assistantmanager at the Oakdale Mall.  Twice divorced, itwas no secret among most of the women whoworked there that the redhead had a weakness forbarely legal boys.  Her various sexual escapadeswould have been enough to get her fired, if not forthe fact that her family was one of the mostprominent in town.          Unless one of her conquests turned out tobe underage -- she was always very careful aboutthat -- or one of the young men filed a complaint,even more unlikely after she had freely given themwhat they all would agree was one hot piece ofass -- Gloria would continue with her littleappetites.             "I guess that would be enough to get himto check out some cocks for you."  Penny finallyadmitted.         "To be honest, since that’s the nature ofthe game,"  Stephanie mused,  "I think most guys,Jerry included, do check the others out, to seehow they compare with each other.  They justdon’t want to admit they look at other guys."        "That’s probably true." both girls agreed,remembering secretly checking out classmates inthe showers back when they all started to develop.         "Now can we forget about all this andwatch the movie or something?"  Stephanie asked.            "Okay,"  Penny agreed.  "But I’m still madat you for one thing."        "What’s that?"  Stephanie asked somewhatconfused.        "You knew that twerp had a 9-inch cockand you didn’t tell any of the rest of us!"        All three of them burst into laughter asRachel refilled all their glasses.            For the next three quarters of an hour, thegirls watched the adult film, offering jokes andcomments about what they saw.  Also during thattime they finished off the first bottle of wine andworked their way halfway through a second.Rachel had also thrown a bag of popcorn into themicrowave. After all, what fun was a moviewithout popcorn?         The plot of the movie, such as there wasof one, was that of an adult television station trying to pick its new fall line-up.  A mixture ofmen and women sat in a boardroom, watchingshort clips of various pilots.  It was one such showthat the girls had already watched.  The clips wereshort on plot but long on sex.  As they went on,the members of the selection committee becamemore and more aroused.  A condition each of thegirls could sympathize with, even if they didn’twant to admit it.         The appearance of a small Asian womanon the screen brought immediate comments fromRachel and Stephanie that she resembled Penny, though in fact the multicultrual girl was differenteverywhere beyond Asian features and similarheight.        "I don’t look like that,"  Penny declared inmock protest, adding with a laugh,  "I have muchnicer tits."          It didn’t take long for the Asian actress tobecome involved with her male co-star.  In fact, ittook less than two minutes for these supposedlytotal strangers to get naked and go at it.  As theydid, Penny’s friends continued to remark at howmuch the girl on the screen really looked like her.        "I don’t know Penny,"  Stephanie musedas she watched the actress deep throat the manwho was as generously endowed as the actor inthe first clip.  "We’ve double dated and I have tosay, that sure looks like you."         "Yeah, are you sure you haven’t beenmoonlighting?"  Rachel chimed in.        "Why?"  Penny laughed.  "Are youjealous?"        Their friendly barbs continued as theon-screen couple continued their endeavors.  Theman climbed behind the girl and positioned hiscock against her ass.  With a loud grunt, hepushed his manhood inside her, accompanied bysqueals of encouragement from his partner.        "Ouch!"  Stephanie cried.  "That’s got tohurt!"        "Well, that proves that’s not me."  Pennygrimaced.  ‘This little ass is much too tight forsomething that big."  she quipped as she pattedher bottom.        "I don’t know,"  Rachel mused.  "I’veheard that if it’s done right it can be quite fun. After all, isn’t that what gay guys do?  There hasto be something pleasurable about it."        "Well when you find out, you can let therest of us know."  Stephanie retorted, wonderingif perhaps her friend had already tried it and didn’twant to admit it.                Another scene change brought an olderwoman in her forties to the screen, already ridingatop a young man who couldn’t be far out of histeens.  Almost immediately all three of them calledout the name of Gloria Nelson.  The fact that thiswoman was a brunette instead of a redheadmattered little.          "I guess that makes that your brother Jerrylaying underneath her."  Penny offered.        "No way,"  Stephanie retorted.  "Mybrother has a much better bod."        As one, Penny and Rachel snapped theirheads around to look in astonishment.        "Oh come on, you both have brothers." Stephanie added tartly. "You can’t tell me thatsomewhere along the line you haven’t gotten apeek at them, just like I’m sure they’ve gotten apeek at you."        Silence gave truth to her assertion.  It wasobvious that the wine, and the movie, were muchresponsible for her frankness.           Back on the screen, the Gloria Nelsonsurrogate was riding the younger man like a rodeorider atop a bull.  Her large unrestrained breastsbouncing in all directions.  The look of ecstasy onher face was a powerful enticement to the joys ofteenage boys.                "What do you think will happen first?" Penny asked.  "He pops his cork or that bedcollapses beneath them?"            "I’d say 50 - 50 either way."  Rachelanswered.        "I’ll go with his popping his cork," Stephanie bet. "That bed is stronger than it looks."        Less than an minute later, Stephanie wonthe bet as "Gloria" suddenly jumped off the youngman and spun around on the bed, her hand neverreleasing it’s grip on his hard cock.  Soon as thebrunette’s face reached his boyhood, it explodedin a shower of hot whiteness, covering her eagerlips and cheeks with his eruption.                The preview faded from view, to bereplaced by another scene.  It looked like thelocker room of the local high school.  From offcamera, the sound of running water could beheard from the showers.        "Anyone care to guess what kind of scenethis one is going to be?"  Penny asked, turning themovie into a sort of guessing game.        "My guess is the Quarterback andCheerleader."  Rachel said as she tossed half ahandful of popcorn into her mouth.        "Teacher and Student’s my guess." Stephanie said.        "I’m going to go with a gang bang." Penny offered with a wicked grin.        The Asian girl won that round as the starof the little epic, a tall statuesque blonde dressedin a very tight white uniform came into the lockerroom.  Evidently she was supposed to be theschool nurse.  She acted surprised when the soundof running water ceased and a half dozen nakedhunks walked into view.          In no time at all, the busty blonde waslaying on one of the benches, a stiff member ineach of her hands, a hard one in her mouth, afourth and fifth in her shaved pussy and tight ass. Standing just off to the right of the after-schoolorgy was the best looking of all the guys, playfullystroking the largest cock of the group and waitingfor an opening he could put it into.            "Guess she never heard of the idea thatyou can have too much of a good thing."  Rachelcommented.        "Maybe,"  Penny said.  "But I’d be glad totake care of the odd man out there."        "Get in line girl."  Stephanie cut in.                For so energetic a scene, it turned out tobe surprisingly short.  The odd man out never didfind his hole, but joined in with his buddies ingiving the nurse a cum shower.        "Well, so much for the idea that more isbetter."  Rachel said.        "Yeah, I think I prefer my sex one onone,"  Stephanie added.        "Me too,"  Penny chimed in.  "Well, maybetwo on one, but no more than that.  Except maybeon special occasions of course."                Rachel and Stephanie both laughed, notsure how much of Penny’s statement was intendedas a joke.         The scene shifted back to the boardroomwere several of the network executives were nowin various stages of undress, already engaged in sexual acts.  One of the female executives, a darkhaired thirty year old, was spread across the table,her dress up around her waist, her legs spreadwide.  Buried between those legs was the face of amale executive.  Kneeing beside that man was oneof the secretaries, her own mouth wrapped tightlyaround the cock sticking out from his threehundred dollar suit.          At the head of the table, the silver-grayhaired chairman of the board was also missing thelower half of his high priced suit, his own cockhowever was not as visible.  Instead it was buriedin the red-haired mound of the second secretarywho was being mounted doggie style by the seniorexecutive.          At the head of the room, the narrator ofthe film, who had also introducing the TV pilots,was trying to ignore the spectacle before him. Hecontinued to tell about the last show on theagenda.  It began to run on the monitor as thenarrator threw up his hand in surrender and pulledout his cock, sliding it into the mouth of theredhead.         The boardroom image faded, replaced bythe kitchen of a small apartment.  Standing at thecounter, her back to the camera, was a youngHispanic woman in her twenties.  Wearing a pairof cut off shorts and a red and white striped tanktop, she was pouring herself a cup of coffee.  Asshe turned to face the camera, a second cup became visible on the counter.  A smile crossed herlips as she tasted the steaming liquid.        Another figure then entered the kitchen, alight skinned brunette wearing a blue bathrobe.Her tousled short hair gave added evidence thatshe had just gotten out of bed. Pushing a lock ofloose hair away from her eyes, she accepted thesecond cup of coffee. In a brief chat the newarrival's name was revealed as Donna and thecoffee maker's as Modesta.         In no time at all, Donna’s robe fell opened,revealing a soft body accented by small curvingmounds, the pink nipples of which were both hardand visible.  The cup at her lips was quicklyreplaced by the equally hot lips of her companion.         With dazzling speed, the darker skinnedgirl traced a wet path down from the brunettes lipsto her breast. The nipple of which quicklydisappeared between her lips.         "Oh my!"  Stephanie gasped as shewatched the onscreen encounter advance to thenext stage.  She had crossed the room to pick upsome more muchies, but had stopped in mid stepat the sight.          In no time at all, Modesta's attentiondropped below her companion’s waist.  Stephaniehad seen women kiss each other on a few daringtelevision shows, had even seen them caress eachother’s breasts in an R rated film, but never hadshe seen a woman performing oral sex on anotherwoman.        The camera zoomed in, giving a close upview of Modesta’s tongue darting up and into thepink recesses of Donna’s pussy.  The picture wasso vivid that Stephanie could see the shiny layer ofnectar Modesta’s ministrations had produced.        ‘God, could you ever imagine doingsomething like that?"  Stephanie asked, her eyesnever leaving the screen.                It took a few long seconds for her torealize her friends hadn’t answered -- which shefound unusual.  She couldn’t ever remember thembeing at a loss for words!        "Could you ever imagine doing anythinglike that?"  she repeated, assuming they hadn’theard her.                The continued silence finally broke herfixation on the screen.  She turned her attentionback to Rachel.  The look on her girlfriend’s facewas akin to that of a kid who’d been caught witha hand in the cookie jar.                       "You’re kidding!"  Stephanie declared.        "Well, if you can be honest about RobbyMcPherson, then I should be honest too."  Rachel admitted.        "I don’t believe it,"  Stephanie said.  "Ithink now you’re putting me on.  Who have youever done it with?"                Rachel took a moment to think about heranswer.  Stephanie expected Rachel to say somedistant friend, if anything.  Instead the brunettelooked past the blond to the other end of the     couch.        Stephanie followed her line of sight, untilit stopped on an equally guilty face.        "Oh no, you had me going for a moment," Stephanie said, a touch of amusement in her tone."But now you’re stretching this a bit too far  --just a little bit over the top.  That was almost asgood as that story you had me believing aboutTracy Conway last month.                Tracy Conway was a somewhat masculinewoman in her thirties who also worked in the Mallat a sporting goods store.  One night, following afew hours of bar-hopping, the other girls hadconvinced Stephanie that Tracy was female as theresult of  a sex change operation.  It tookStephanie a week to discover it had been a joke.          Stephanie looked again at both of herfriends.  Neither one of them were laughing thistime.  Instead they shared a silent communication.        Without a word Penny got up from thecouch and walked past Stephanie. When shereached Rachel, the young Asian woman reachedup and gently stroked her cheek.  Then she pulledthe taller woman down to her level and kissed heron the lips.          It was a soft kiss at first, the kind that onefriend might give another, no different than someStephanie herself had gotten.  Then it becamemore and more erotic, a melding of lips and eagertongues.  Rachel responded in turn, pressing hardagainst the younger girl.        Stephanie was still trying to decide if thiswas a gag when Penny pushed the game evenfurther.  She slipped her hand up under Rachel’sT-shirt and fondled the naked flesh beneath it.         Breaking the kiss, she pulled up the thinmaterial and planted kisses on Rachel’s nowexposed breasts as well. Mimicking Modesta’sactions on the cable station, Penny slid her tongueunder Rachel’s erect nipple and guided it into hermouth.               "Shit,"  Stephanie finally exclaimed in arush of air. "This isn’t a joke."        With that, the two lovers ended theirembrace and faced their friend.  Their faces nowreflected a look of expectation.                Glancing back at the TV image, Stephanienoted that the two woman were now locked in a69 position, their mouths pressed tightly in eachother’s wet mounds.  What truly startled her wasthat, in her mind, instead of Donna and Modesta,the forms she now saw pressed together werethose of Rachel and Penny.                "Is it really as much fun as it looks?"  shewondered out loud.        In reply, she felt a soft hand come to reston her shoulder.           "We’d be happy to show you if you’rereally interested."  Rachel said.  "The only reasonwe never asked before is we weren’t sure of howyou’d react."        "Then why did you tell me now?" Stephanie asked.        "Honestly, I’m not sure,"  Stephanielaughed softly, trying to break the underlyingtension. "I didn’t plan it this way, it just seemedthe perfect time."        Stephanie thought about it for a briefmoment and decided that events had indeed madethis the perfect time.  The wine, the conversationthey’d been having had put them all at ease withwhat would normally have been a very awkwardsubject.        "And if  I thought that this wasn’t the sortof thing for me?"  Stephanie asked.        "Then I hope we’d just forget it all andstill be the same friends we all were 10 minutesago." Rachel replied.              Stephanie again looked past Rachel toPenny.  The younger girl hadn’t said a single wordsince Stephanie’s revelation.  She didn’t have to.The look in her eyes and on her face was amixture of apprehension and lust.        "Well I’ve always said,"  Stephanie said,placing her hand atop Rachel’s.  "You should tryeverything in life -- at least once."          She shifted her body ever so slightly, justenough to bring herself face to face with Rachel. Leaning forward, she pressed her lips against her.                It wasn’t the first time she had ever kissedRachel.  There had been many occasions when shekissed other girls, but never like this.  The touchof their lips now seemed electric.  A warmthspread throughout their bodies from that briefcontact.  The kiss was at the same time both briefand endless.          Still unsure of the situation, Rachel letStephanie take the lead.  It wasn’t until the blondkissed her a second time that Rachel began torespond.        Stephanie closed her eyes and the passionbuilding within her take control. She pushed hertongue into Rachel’s mouth, exploring thesoftness of it’s mirror image.        Rachel took hold of Stephanie’s hands andpressed them against her breasts. Tentatively, sheexplored the material covered mounds.  It was thefirst time she had ever felt the softness of aanother woman’s breast, the hardness of erectnipples.        As Stephanie continued to explore herfriends body, Rachel slid her own hands up anddown her friend’s back.  She took hold of thezipper of her dress and pulled it down, exposingthe flesh beneath it.  She caressed that flesh,running her nails across it.                The touch of a new hand caused Stephanieto open her eyes.  Penny now stood next to her aswell, a wide smile on her face.  Stephanie shiftedher attention to the youngest of her friends andkissed her too.  A kiss equal in intensity to thatshe had just given Rachel.  To Stephanie’s delight,the reaction she felt to it was also the same.        The three young women stood interlockedin the center of the room, kissing, exploring eachothers bodies, loosening clothing and searchingout the flesh beneath it.        "Maybe we should all just take a minuteand get comfortable."  Rachel suggestion.         The other’s nodded their agreement, andthey all took a few steps back from each other. Rachel was wearing the least so it took her only afew seconds to drop her shirt and panties to thefloor.  Standing naked in the center of the roomfor the second time that night, she took a momentto shut off the television. There was no longer anyneed for it, not when a much more interestingentertainment was about to commence.        Penny and Stephanie took only a littlelonger.  A small pile of clothes rested at eachgirl’s feet, topped by undergarments of variousdesigns.  Now they all stood naked, looking ateach other during an awkward pause.        Only a short time before, Stephanie hadfelt a little strange looking at Rachel’s nakedbody. Now she looked with a different eye.  All ofthem took a moment to look at each other.         Stephanie was surprised to see that Pennyhad shaved the hair between her legs.  She knewfrom brief glimpses that there never had beenmuch there to begin with.  But the absence of thatlittle bit made the small girl seem even more like ateenager. Rachel on the other hand, had a widepatch of dark brown hair.  Stephanie’s own bushwas somewhere between the two extremes and alight blond.        Even their breasts formed a sharp contrast, not just in size, ranging from Rachel’s 38C toPenny’s 34B, but in the very shape of them. Stephanie’s were very rounded with wide pinkcircles around short pink nipples.  Rachel’smounds were conical in nature with puffy areolasthat stuck out even further.  Penny had the darkestnipples of the three, a rich dark brown againstbutternut skin.                  "So now what?"  Stephanie asked as shetossed her hands up in the air.        "Why don’t you make yourselfcomfortable on the couch," Rachel suggested witha smile.  "and let us take care of getting thingsstarted."        Thinking it not a bad suggestion at all,Stephanie sat down on the center of the widecouch.  Rachel and Penny sat down beside her,tossing the larger throw pillows onto thehardwood floor.  They would come in handy later.        Penny kissed Stephanie.  Then Rachelkissed Stephanie.  Then, leaning across the middlegirl, Penny kissed Rachel.  As they did, they eachcupped the closest of Stephanie’s breasts, playingtheir fingers across her nipples - enjoying thestiffness found there.        Stephanie couldn’t help but compare thetouch of the two women to that of men she’dknown.  For the most part, it was softer -- yet atthe same time much more erotic.  As were the sensations it produced.  Even more pleasing werethe waves of delight that filled her breasts whenthose skillful fingers where replaced with evenmore talented mouths.         Matching tongues traced a path acrosssupple flesh, until they met in the rich valleybetween the mounds.  There the two lovers kissedonce more before parting in different directions.         Penny continued to kiss and caressStephanie’s breasts, alternating between softtouches and gentle bites.  Working her way backto Stephanie’s willing mouth, she pressed herdarker breasts hard against the those of the girlbeneath her. The nipple to nipple contact wasenough to elicit a soft moan from Stephanie.  Amoan cut short by the crush of Penny’s mouth.        Rachel had moved her attentions lower,dropping down to sit on one of the oversizedcushions.  With a hand on each of Stef’s thighs,she spread them apart to expose the blond-framedpearl.        Burying her head between the pale legs,Rachel ran her tongue along the length of herfriend’s womanhood -- her heart racing withexcitement at the idea that she was the firstwoman ever to do so.  The scent of Stephanie’salready damp mound was intoxicating, a feastwaiting to be savored.         Not to be denied, she drove her tongue upbetween the folds of those sugar walls, clearing apath to the clitoris.  A path quickly followed.        "Oh God!!"  Stephanie gasped as she feltRachel’s tongue strike her like the spark to amatch.  It was enough for her to momentaryforget the girl still playing with both her breastsand mouth.          But only for a moment as Penny liftedherself higher and guided one of her own richmounds to Stephanie’s lips.  Her mouth still openfrom her gasp, Penny pushed her erect nipplebetween the blonde’s red lips.        There had often been times whenStephanie had often wondered what it might feellike to suck on a woman’s breasts.  Her ownmounds were too small to try it on herself.  She’dincluded sucking on a man’s nipples as part of herloveplay, but she was sure it wasn’t the same.        Now with the reality between her teeth,she knew that her earlier conclusion was right. Playing with a man’s nipples was nothing like thereal thing of a woman.  She could taste Penny in away that she never could a man, delighting in themixture of soft and hard.  She ran her tongue backand forth across the dark, pert tips, trying torepeat the pleasing affect that Penny had producedin her.           As the now saturated nipple slipped fromher lips, Penny wrapped her hands around theback of Stephanie’s head, guiding her face to thesoft spot between her breasts, inviting her to feastthere as well, an invitation Stephanie was all toowilling to accept.  She licked her way across thedamp skin, enjoying the heady aroma filling hernostrils. Then with girlish delight she repeated herperformance on Penny’s other mound.        Her interest still fixed on Stephanie’spussy, Rachel slid one finger, then another deepwithin it.  The initial wetness she found there increased as she moved her fingers back and forth. With their motion waves of enchantmentexpanded to fill Stephanie’s relaxed form.        Rachel augmented the touch of her fingerswith that of her tongue, reaching her friend’s mostsensitive spots as if they were familiar as her own. In truth many of them were identical.          If Stephanie had time to think about it --which her two friends were definitely not allowing-- she might have appreciated the irony of thesituation.  Rachel, who cringed at the thought oftaking a man in her mouth, had no such hesitationwhere another woman was involved.        "This feels so fucking good!"  Stephaniemoaned as she laid back and enjoyed thetwo-pronged assault on her body.  "I don’t thinkI’ve ever felt this fantastic."         As Penny climbed off Stephanie, Rachelalso moved back.  Together they guided theirneophyte lover onto the large pillows they hadearlier tossed to the floor.  As soon as Stephanielaid across the pillows, Rachel again spread herlegs and went right back to where she left off.        Penny had other ideas.  It was timeStephanie learned how to give as well as receive.Squatting over Stephanie’s face, Penny droppeddown until her pussy was only a few inches aboveit.        Prior to this moment, Stephanie had neverseen another woman’s sex close up.  The fact thatPenny’s was totally hairless gave it an even moreinteresting perspective.  The first thing she noticedwas that for such a small girl, Penny had anunusually large clitoris. It was almost like a tinypenis.         No imagination was needed for Stephanieto figure out what Penny wanted. Unlike Rachel,Stephanie never had a problem with oral sex, sowith virginal enthusiasm, she reached out with hertongue and ran it across Penny’s erect clit.        "Oh yeah baby,"  Penny panted.  "Go forit!"        Go for it Stephanie did, pulling Penny’sclit between her lips, massaging it with hertongue.  Then she swept it back across the lengthof Penny’s pussy, savoring her first taste of awoman.          The scent of Penny's sex was almostoverpowering, and to her delight she learned withher first lick that the taste was all she hoped itwould be.  Penny lowered her pelvis further sothat Stephanie could have easier access to her wetcunt.          Slowly at first, Stephanie licked theyounger girl, exploring her womanhood.  Thenshe began to quicken the pace until she reached arhythm that sent little ripples throughout Penny'sbody.          Ripples that mirrored those fillingStephanie's body as Rachel continued to workmagic between her legs.  As one hand continuedto slide outstretched fingers up and down theblond framed love canal, the brunette’s other handworked the same enchantment on her own -- withmuch the same results.        Faster and faster all three of them went,plunging down the well of ecstasy.  It was a raceto rapture - a pursuit each wanted to win.          To her surprise, Stephanie produced thefirst orgasm as Penny’s body suddenly convulsedagainst her mouth and it filled with a blast ofhoney.  It was such a sexual rush that it sentStephanie’s own body over the edge, showering Rachel with the same gift.  A reward she hungrilyaccepted.        Finally, Rachel joined the chorus, meremoments behind the others, propelled by thesymphony of her fingers                  "Oh my god!"  Stephanie exclaimed asthey laid naked on the floor, still entwined in eachother’s bodies.  "I can’t believe how intense thatwas.  How did you ever get the idea to trysomething like this ... and how long have you beendoing it?"                "Well it was originally Penny’s idea." Rachel replied, running her hand alongsidePenny’s cheek.  "And we’ve been doing it, as youcall it, for the last six months."        Stephanie turned to Penny, but before shecould ask the question on her lips, Pennyanswered it with a laugh.        "I’ve been doing it since I was 16. Whatcan I say?  I’ve always been an advanced learner."                 The other two girls joined in the laughteras they continued to stroke and kiss each other. They all knew what had just happened was onlythe beginning.  There would be many more littleadventures in their collective future.                "Err ... Rachel,"  Stephanie suddenly askedseriously.  "Remember what you said earliertonight about the nameplate on the door?"        "Of course,"  Rachel answered, wonderingwhy Stephanie was suddenly concerned aboutsomething so mundane.        "I think you might want to try andremember that a little harder in the future." Stephanie continued.                "Oh shit!" Penny cried out abruptly, cutting off any further inquiry Rachel might havehad about Stephanie’s sudden tangent.                Rachel followed Penny’s gaze until allthree of them were looking at the front doorway. An entrance now filled by the tall figure of a darkskinned young woman in a bright red raincoat,holding a silver keychain in her hand.                "Fuck!"  Rachel blurted out," "Pamela!"        They all sat silent after that for longseconds,  like statues in some far off garden.                "Looks like I missed one hell of a party." Pamela said as she pulled off her raincoat anddraped it over a wall hook, revealing a bluebusiness suit.  "And here I thought I knew whatkind of people my friends were." she said in a hurttone.                 "Oh fuck!"  Rachel repeated.  The othertwo girls were still too stunned to say anythingelse.                "I am disappointed in you all,"  Pameladeclared as she stepped into the room and stoodover the naked trio.  "I thought we were supposedto be the Four Musketeers!"                It took a few seconds for them to realizethat the oldest of their little group wasn’t reallyangry or shocked at all. In fact, it was nowbecoming obvious that she hadn’t just walked ineither. How long she’d been watching was anquestion unasked -- at least for now.          With smiles now filling their faces, allthree girls reached up and pulled Pamela downinto the center of their circle.  She seemed a littleout of place with her conservative attire, butwithin a few minutes that was gone as well.  Herdark form was soon covered by an intermix oflighter hues.                Hours later, long after the rain hadstopped and the night once more grew quiet, thesounds of passion could still be heard.  Thequartet truly learned the meaning of their motto. One for all, and all for one.    END #*#

IEEE History Center - Milestone: Monochrome-Compatible, Electronic ColorTelevision, 1946-1953New Page 10 What's News Who We Are Where We Are On-LineResources Other Resources IEEE Archives Milestones Mystery Photo Challenge Related Sites How We're Supported Going Digital Awards IEEE History CenterRutgers-The State Univ.39 Union StreetNew Brunswick, NJ  USA 08901-8538+1-732-932-1066 (Office)+1-732-932-1193 (Fax)history@ieee.orgIEEE History CenterIEEE MilestonesMonochrome-Compatible,Electronic Color Television, 1946-1953EricWendt, Chair,IEEE Princeton/Central New Jersey Section, Harry Kihn, IEEE LifeFellow and Jim Carnes, President and CEO-Sarnoff Corporation, unveil the IEEE MilestonePlaque.On this site between 1946 and 1950 the research staff of RCA Laboratories invented theworlds first electronic, monochrome- compatible, color television system. They workedwith other engineers in the industry for three years to develop a national analog standardbased on this system, which lasted until the transition to digital broadcasting.     The Radio Corporation of America's (RCA) color system was theonly one designed to be directly compatible with monochrome broadcast transmissions andthe only one that used no moving parts. Until the researchers at the RCA Laboratories tookup the challenge after World War II, it appeared that the Federal CommunicationsCommission (FCC) would approve the Columbia Broadcasting Systems (CBS)electromechanical system of color television. This was incompatible with the monochrometelevision system established before World War II. Encouraged by chief executive DavidSarnoff and supported by engineers at other branches of the corporation, the staff at RCALabs laid out the conceptual framework, established most of the principles andtechniques, and demonstrated the technologies necessary for the electronic pickup,broadcast, and reception of color television in the home. This system, with contributionsby other companies, became an international standard still used for analog colortelevision.     The laboratories researchers, led by Ray D.Kell,experimented with electromechanical field sequential color systems during and shortlyafter the war, demonstrating such a system to the FCC in December 1945. Despite thedemos success, Elmer Engstrom and the Labs management realized the practicallimitations of the technology in terms of picture brightness, monochrome compatibility,and scalability of the picture image. Such systems used a three-color filter on a wheelapproximately three times the size of the image. To reduce flicker to an acceptable level,the wheel spun at 3600 rpm.     In 1946, then, RCAcommitted to developing an all-electronic system designed to the same reception standardsenjoyed on monochrome sets. By 1947, Kells group had demonstrated two versions ofelectronic color television, the highlight of which was the use of Alda V. Bedfordsprinciple of mixed highs. Bedford showed that the human eye could distinguish changes inbrightness but not in color at high levels of detail. Therefore high-frequency componentsof the primary colorsred, green, and bluecould be blended and carried on oneof the color signals, reducing the amount of bandwidth necessary for transmission.     By the end of1948, however, technical and regulatory pressures forced the Labs researchers tostart finding ways to compress the bandwidth for color to the six megahertz (MHz) used formonochrome in the VHF section of the electromagnetic spectrum. Until then, they and theFCC had counted on broadcasting color in the UHF section, using up to 14.5 MHz perchannel. Princeton staff under Dr. George Brown discovered the difficulties in using theUHF band for television in terms of both propagation and power consumption, while thegrowing demand for channels indicated that broadcasters would use 6 MHz allotments in UHFas an extension of VHF.     In January 1949,Brown, Bedford, Kell, David Luck, William Cherry, George Sziklai, and Alfred Schroederagreed that RCAs objective should be a system in which color signals could bereceived without adjustment in monochrome on black-and-white sets while monochrome signalscould be received by color sets. The broadcast signal should take up no more than the 6MHz bandwidth allotted for monochrome, and the picture quality should be equivalent inresolution, brightness, and flicker. Elmer Engstrom, then Vice President in Charge ofResearch, RCA Laboratories, summarized the methods by which RCA would accomplish thesegoals:(a) A brightness picture for the operationof black-and-white receivers.(b) Color information carried on asubcarrier. The subcarrier phase or relative time position was the code used to convey hueinformation, while the strength of the subcarrier conveyed the saturation information.(c) The frequency of the subcarrier was tobe an odd multiple of one half the line scanning frequency. This was another applicationof the interlace principle, designed to reduce the visibility of the subcarrier in thepicture displayed on monochrome receivers. This method of choosing the frequency of thesubcarrier gave rise to the name "dot interlace."(d) The "mixed highs" principleto transmit the fine detail of the picture.     Bedfords"mixed highs," along with Clarence Hansells application of time-divisionmultiplexing to color broadcast transmissions, enabled the compression of the televisedsignal into two components. One carried the luminance, or brightness, and the other thechrominance, or color information. A monochrome set would simply ignore the colorcomponent on the subcarrier. Receiving monochrome signals on a color receiver proved morecomplicated, but Harry Kihns "Kolor Killer" circuit resolved the problem.Thus, color and monochrome receivers would be able to display, without adjustment,transmissions of monochrome and color programs.     Mixed highs andmultiplexing also reduced bandwidth usage so that, along with John Evanss andRandall Ballards proposal to use dot interlacing to scan the colors, the Princetonengineers established the basis for modern analog color television. The dot sequentialcolor system involved high-speed time-division multiplexing using a sampling frequency of3.583125 MHz. Initially, synchronization of the sampling frequencies between thetransmitter and receiver was accomplished by varying the timing of the trailing edge ofthe horizontal sync pulse, thereby controlling the sampling phasing and color dotinterlace on a line-to-line basis. Bedford overcame the instability of this method bysuggesting that a reference burst of the color sampling frequency be transmitted duringthe "rear porch" of the horizontal sync waveform.     To reduce colorfringing within the narrower transmission, Schroeder and Kell adapted quadrature-amplitudemodulation to transmit a wideband orange-cyan I axis and narrowband green-purple Q axis.This provided full-color reproduction in video frequencies of less than 0.5 MHz by the Qand I axes, two-color reproduction between 0.5 and 1.5 MHz by the I axis, and monochromedetail between 1.5 MHz and 4.2 MHz. RCA announced its compatible, dot-sequential system onAugust 25, 1949, broadcasts of which began in September on NBC's WNBW Channel 4 inWashington, D.C.     Until then, thesedevelopments had taken place in relative obscurity at the Princeton Labs. When the FCCannounced that hearings on proposed formats for color television would begin in September,however, RCAs R&D on the system commanded the attention of the government, themedia, and the competition for the next eight months. During this time, despite thedistractions, the Labs staff transmitted color broadcast signals throughAT&Ts 2.7 megacycle coaxial cable, conducted channel-interference tests for itsown and competing systems, showed undistorted monochrome signals on a color set, and,perhaps most importantly, developed a single-cathode ray tube color receiver.     During thehearings in October and November, RCA demonstrated a system that, when not suffering theeffects of a heat wave, indicated the feasibility of a compatible electronic colortelevision system. The images were not impressive compared to the improved CBS system, theweak point being the receiver. The "triniscope" used three kinescope tubes andan arrangement of mirrors to project the color image on a screen. The sheer bulk of thisdesign required that the labs develop a more practical alternative for the home to gainapproval of their system from a commission that wanted color television implemented assoon as possible. Engstrom promised the FCC that RCA would have a full-color cathode raytube (CRT) ready in six months. This provoked a crash research and development effort, thesuccess of which contradicted the many experts who claimed it couldnt be done.     Researchersdeveloped five versions of the single tube but all agreed that Harold B. Lawsrefinement of Schroeders shadowmask tube offered the best solution. The tricolorpicture tube resembled a monochrome receiver, where the screens glow was based onthe intensity of the electron beam and signal. The main difference was that the color tubecontained three electron guns, one for each of the primary colors. The mask was placednext to the screen and allowed the guns to strike the screen through hundreds of thousandsof perforations. Deposited on the screen were hundreds of thousands of tiny phosphorclumps, each comprised of three discrete dots. When the guns struck the appropriate dots,they emitted red, blue, and green light according to the intensity of the beam. Therelative brightness of the phosphors determined the colors seen by the viewer.     Over the winter,more than fifty scientists and engineers at the Princeton Labs, supported by technical andadministrative staff, worked with engineers at RCAs CRT plant in Lancaster,Pennsylvania, to make a demonstration model. By the end of March, 1950, as promised, RCAshowed the FCC its color picture tube in a receiver similar to those consumers bought forblack-and-white television. More than any other component of the system, the shadow-maskCRT made color television a practical household technology.     RCA also continuedto improve camera tubes. In a studio environment, size was less of a problem. Princetonstaff, led by Dr. Paul K. Weimer, borrowed from the monochrome system that he had helpedinvent and applied it to color. The color camera was composed of three image orthicons,the standard tube for broadcasting developed at the labs during World War II. Each imageorthicon scanned an image in a primary color, treating it like a monochrome picture. Thecamera circuitry then blended the three primaries--red, green, and blue--and sent theimage to the amplifier. RCA introduced the first commercial color camera, the TK-40, basedon this design, in 1952. Weimer and his team continued to work on a single-tube colorcamera based on their two-inch vidicon tube, which RCA announced three years later.     In July 1950, theNational Bureau of Standards (NBS) reported that the RCA system demonstrated itssuperiority in more (12) of the eighteen categories than CBSs line-interlaced system(9). It also offered the most "opportunity for improvement." Despite this reportand the demonstrations of RCAs basic technologies and principles of electroniccolor-compatible television, the FCC rejected RCAs system in September 1950.     The rest of thetelevision industry agreed with the NBS, however, and had already started refining theformat and technologies developed by the labs. The second National Television SystemCommittee (NTSC) , comprised of engineers from all the interested parties, was organizedin January 1950. Members of the industry and the FCC agreed to develop with RCA a standardfor electronic color television broadcasting and reception. The NTSC adoptedspecifications for field testing in December, 1951. As Elmer Engstrom pointed out, thespecifications did not differ significantly from what RCA had proposed in 1946:(a) A brightness picture for the operationof black-and-white receivers.(b) Color information transmitted on asubcarrier with hue information related to the phase of the subcarrier and saturationinformation related to the amplitude of the subcarrier.(c) The frequency of the subcarrier be anodd multiple of half the line scanning frequency.(d) The "mixed highs" principleto be applied to convey information concerning fine detail through the use of a bypassedbrightness signal.      The mostsignificant contributions to RCAs system came from the Hazeltine Corporation.Hazeltine, which had a cross-licensing agreement with RCA, demonstrated to the Princetonlab researchers its concepts of constant luminance and "shunted monochrome" inApril 1950. The latter resolved one of the problems of compatibility between electroniccolor transmission and its reception on a monochrome receiver, and was similar to an ideaGeorge Brown had frequently sketched but never patented. Constant luminance represented anextension of Bedfords mixed-highs principle to changes in brightness over time andsignificantly improved the picture image. On December 5, 1950, RCA demonstrated its systemusing what it called the "bypassed" monochrome concept which resulted in greatlyreduced moiré patterns on the shadow-mask tube.      RCA unveiled itsfinal system in June 1951 at NBCs Washington studios. A week later, RCA conductedanother successful demonstration at the RCA Exhibition Hall in Manhattan, featuringNanette Fabray. Extensive field testing using this standard began in February 1952 byseveral manufacturers with continued RCA support. A year later, the second NTSC publishedits color standard which, but for a minimal adjustment to the color subcarrier frequency,followed RCAs lead.     After RCAcarried out more field tests, the NTSC forwarded this standard to the FCC in a petition onJuly 22, 1953. The FCC approved the standard on December 17 and it has remained in placefor analog color television transmission ever since.HistoryCenter HomeIf you would like to contact the IEEE Webmaster, email to webmaster@ieee.org© Copyright  2003, IEEE.   Terms& Conditions.  Privacy & Security.(mailto:m.hoffman@ieee.org) URL: http://www.ieee.org/organizations/history_center/colortv.html(Modified: 02 January 2003 10:25 AM)#*#HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"#*#IEEE History Center - Milestone: Monochrome-Compatible, Electronic ColorTelevision, 1946-1953New Page 10 What's News Who We Are Where We Are On-LineResources Other Resources IEEE Archives Milestones Mystery Photo Challenge Related Sites How We're Supported Going Digital Awards IEEE History CenterRutgers-The State Univ.39 Union StreetNew Brunswick, NJ  USA 08901-8538+1-732-932-1066 (Office)+1-732-932-1193 (Fax)history@ieee.orgIEEE History CenterIEEE MilestonesMonochrome-Compatible,Electronic Color Television, 1946-1953EricWendt, Chair,IEEE Princeton/Central New Jersey Section, Harry Kihn, IEEE LifeFellow and Jim Carnes, President and CEO-Sarnoff Corporation, unveil the IEEE MilestonePlaque.On this site between 1946 and 1950 the research staff of RCA Laboratories invented theworlds first electronic, monochrome- compatible, color television system.

The FCC approved the standard on December 17 and it has remained in placefor analog color television transmission ever since.#*#HistoryCenter Home#*#If you would like to contact the IEEE Webmaster, email to webmaster@ieee.org#*#© #*#Copyright#*#  2003, IEEE.   #*#Terms& Conditions#*#.  #*#Privacy & Security#*#.#*#(mailto:m.hoffman@ieee.org) URL: http://www.ieee.org/organizations/history_center/colortv.html(Modified: 02 January 2003 10:25 AM)#*#

September 7, 1999The fiery indignation of God Almighty against Richard Holmes, the late Chief Justice of Kansas"For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries."(Heb. 10:26,27)WBC members will rise up and give testimony against Holmes in the Great Judgment Day of GodYes, Mr. Justice Holmes, when he held temporary power over the lives, fortunes, reputations, and happiness of his fellow creatures, prostituted that power corruptly to Satan’s cause, and lifted up his hand against the Lord’s people. They asked for no favors -- only that he do justice. Holmes deliberately -- in the cold light of day, and with full knowledge of his sins in the doing of it -- did injustice. It is not well with him now.Mr. Justice Holmes mocked God & His WordEven after his retirement from the bench, Holmes angrily accosted the humble members of Westboro Baptist Church on the sidewalk outside Topeka Bible Church because he did not like WBC’s anti-gay Gospel message. The Lord Jesus Christ evidently had judges like Homes in mind when He said, "There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man." Lk. 18:2. Holmes must now answer to that God.His crooked fellow judges can’t help him nowThis evil man -- Richard W. Holmes -- is now in a jurisdiction where the encomiums of his fellow judicial perverts will have a negative effect. Holmes is now in Hell with Herod, Harold Fatzer, Alfred Schroeder, Earl O’Connor, et al. He will soon be joined in Hell by David Prager, Richard Rogers, Mike Barbara, Robert Miller, Harold Herd & Sam Crow (the last two being devoted patrons of the Bloody Vintage), et al.#*#September 7, 1999#*#The fiery indignation of God Almighty against Richard Holmes, the late Chief Justice of Kansas#*#"For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries."(Heb. 10:26,27)#*#WBC members will rise up and give testimony against Holmes in the Great Judgment Day of God#*#Yes, Mr. Justice Holmes, when he held temporary power over the lives, fortunes, reputations, and happiness of his fellow creatures, prostituted that power corruptly to Satan’s cause, and lifted up his hand against the Lord’s people.

Andrew Powell's ColdFusion, Mach-II, Flex, and Spry BlogAndrew Powell's ColdFusion, Mach-II, Flex, and Spry BlogOS X :: Building A Better FinderPosted At : December 6, 2006 10:49 PM | Posted By : AndyRelated Categories:AppleIt looks like CocoaTech has built a better mousetrap when it comes to the OS X Finder.  Let's face it, the Finder hasn't changed much since OS 9.  It needs an update.  Path Finder is everything I wish Finder was, and more.     Path Finder is a Finder replacement tool.  It can be configured to work like the Finder that comes with OS X, but it is a bit tricky.  If you're looking for a good replacemnt for the Finder and are willing to fork over a few bucks for it, take a look at Path Finder.

There's a good reason:    This past Saturday, we had a new arrival.  My wife and I welcomed our second daughter,  Ava Marie Powell at 8:49AM.  She weighed in at 5lb even and was 18.5 inches long.  This is huge compared to our first daughter, Nora (3yrs old), who was born at 3lb 3oz!    Nora is running around telling anyone who will listen that she's the big sister.  Mom and baby are home and doing well, so it's back to work for me.

CFCHART is a powerful utility.  It will generate graphs and charts for you inline on your CFM pages, but it will also allow you to store the results into a variable by simply using the "name" attribute.  This variable can then be written to disk and used later at the developer's discretion.  With this functionality in mind, I set forth to use this technique to dynamically update a graphical representation of data using Spry and CFCHART.

So I get this nice nifty broadband phone for my Vonage account and hook it up to my network, go through the hoops of setting the account up and what-not.  Turn the device on and it lights up green.  Green is always a happy colour.  We like green lights.  It means stuff is working....most of the time.  I soon found out that I could make calls out, but not receive them.  Slight problem.    I had the device sitting behind my NetScreen 5XP firewall.  I tried all the suggestions to get it working to no avail.  So I had to do what I like to call some "creative engineering".  I like to think that I know a few things about designing networks.  I've done some wild and crazy setups in my time, but this is one of the most rigged.      I put the Vonage device as the first connection after my DSL modem.  It is making the connection to my ISP.  Behind it, in it's NAT range is the NetScreen.  The NetScreen is doing  NAT to my network.  Basically, I'm doing double NAT.  NAT from the Vonage device to the firewall and NAT from the firewall to my network.  The Vonage device is set to send all ports (except the Vonage ports) through to the firewall.      I did this because I have a TON of ACLs set up in my firewall and I really didn't think that the security offered by the Vonage device is all that great.  I feel a bit more secure now, but this is sure one hokey setup.  We'll see how long it holds.

It will not acknowledge the useCache: false argument in the constructor of the Spry Dataset.  You have to use these two steps:    1. Disallow caching in the header of the page that makes the Spry call, not the XML doc itself.  <cfheader name="Cache-Control" value= "no-cache"> <cfheader name="Expires" value="0"> <cfheader name="Pragma" value="no-cache"> 2. Setup sometype of dynamic url for your XML.  i.e. add the current datetime object to the end of your url as a parameter.     <script type="text/javascript"> var ds1 = new Spry.Data.XMLDataSet(null,null,{useCache:false}); function loadMyData() { var d = new Date(); ds1.setURL("http://myserver/myxml.xml?cacheBuster="  + d.now()); ds1.setXPath("root/element"); ds1.loadData() } </script> <body onload="loadMyData()"> ... </body> This is a known bug with IE and can bite you if you have some dynamic data in Spry that needs to be reloaded at any interval.

Apple Signs Deal To Integrate iPod into Airline EntertainmentPosted At : November 14, 2006 9:22 PM | Posted By : AndyRelated Categories:GeneralWith all the fanfare over Zune today, this kinda flew under the radar (pun intended).    From MacRumors.com:      Apple has announced a partnership with a number of airlines to provide in-flight iPod integration during flights.    In-flight iPod connectivity will be available to Air France, Continental, Delta, Emirates, KLM and United passengers beginning in mid 2007. Additionally, Apple is working with Panasonic Avionics Corporation to bring even more leading airlines in-flight iPod connectivity in the future.    According to the press release, these six airlines will begin offering their passengers iPod seat connections which power and charge their iPods during flight and allow the video content on their iPods to be viewed on the their seat back displays. The press release did not specify whether the iPod integration would be a first-class accommodation, as presumably that designation would be up to the individual airlines.

I did some searching for a tool to create JavaDoc-like documentation and found JSDoc at SourceForge.  I installed it on my server and ran the Spry JS files through it.  There were interesting results.  As it turns out, our friends over at Adobe have not been commenting in the JavaDoc style, which is to be expected if they're not writing it for this tool, specifically.

Let's face it, the Finder hasn't changed much since OS 9.  It needs an update.  Path Finder is everything I wish Finder was, and more.     Path Finder is a Finder replacement tool.  It can be configured to work like the Finder that comes with OS X, but it is a bit tricky.  If you're looking for a good replacemnt for the Finder and are willing to fork over a few bucks for it, take a look at Path Finder.

There's a good reason:    This past Saturday, we had a new arrival.  My wife and I welcomed our second daughter,  Ava Marie Powell at 8:49AM.  She weighed in at 5lb even and was 18.5 inches long.  This is huge compared to our first daughter, Nora (3yrs old), who was born at 3lb 3oz!    Nora is running around telling anyone who will listen that she's the big sister.  Mom and baby are home and doing well, so it's back to work for me.

CFCHART is a powerful utility.  It will generate graphs and charts for you inline on your CFM pages, but it will also allow you to store the results into a variable by simply using the "name" attribute.  This variable can then be written to disk and used later at the developer's discretion.  With this functionality in mind, I set forth to use this technique to dynamically update a graphical representation of data using Spry and CFCHART.

So I get this nice nifty broadband phone for my Vonage account and hook it up to my network, go through the hoops of setting the account up and what-not.  Turn the device on and it lights up green.  Green is always a happy colour.  We like green lights.  It means stuff is working....most of the time.  I soon found out that I could make calls out, but not receive them.  Slight problem.    I had the device sitting behind my NetScreen 5XP firewall.  I tried all the suggestions to get it working to no avail.  So I had to do what I like to call some "creative engineering".  I like to think that I know a few things about designing networks.  I've done some wild and crazy setups in my time, but this is one of the most rigged.      I put the Vonage device as the first connection after my DSL modem.  It is making the connection to my ISP.  Behind it, in it's NAT range is the NetScreen.  The NetScreen is doing  NAT to my network.  Basically, I'm doing double NAT.  NAT from the Vonage device to the firewall and NAT from the firewall to my network.  The Vonage device is set to send all ports (except the Vonage ports) through to the firewall.      I did this because I have a TON of ACLs set up in my firewall and I really didn't think that the security offered by the Vonage device is all that great.  I feel a bit more secure now, but this is sure one hokey setup.  We'll see how long it holds.

It will not acknowledge the useCache: false argument in the constructor of the Spry Dataset.  You have to use these two steps:    1. Disallow caching in the header of the page that makes the Spry call, not the XML doc itself.  <cfheader name="Cache-Control" value= "no-cache"> <cfheader name="Expires" value="0"> <cfheader name="Pragma" value="no-cache"> 2. Setup sometype of dynamic url for your XML.  i.e. add the current datetime object to the end of your url as a parameter.     <script type="text/javascript"> var ds1 = new Spry.Data.XMLDataSet(null,null,{useCache:false}); function loadMyData() { var d = new Date(); ds1.setURL("http://myserver/myxml.xml?cacheBuster="  + d.now()); ds1.setXPath("root/element"); ds1.loadData() } </script> <body onload="loadMyData()"> ... </body> This is a known bug with IE and can bite you if you have some dynamic data in Spry that needs to be reloaded at any interval.

Apple Signs Deal To Integrate iPod into Airline EntertainmentPosted At : November 14, 2006 9:22 PM | Posted By : AndyRelated Categories:GeneralWith all the fanfare over Zune today, this kinda flew under the radar (pun intended).    From MacRumors.com:      Apple has announced a partnership with a number of airlines to provide in-flight iPod integration during flights.    In-flight iPod connectivity will be available to Air France, Continental, Delta, Emirates, KLM and United passengers beginning in mid 2007. Additionally, Apple is working with Panasonic Avionics Corporation to bring even more leading airlines in-flight iPod connectivity in the future.    According to the press release, these six airlines will begin offering their passengers iPod seat connections which power and charge their iPods during flight and allow the video content on their iPods to be viewed on the their seat back displays. The press release did not specify whether the iPod integration would be a first-class accommodation, as presumably that designation would be up to the individual airlines.

Since it's not too far from ATL and the wife has some friends in BNA, I am planning on doing this in person and not Acrobat Connecting it in.  It will be my last tune up before the Frameworks Conference so come out and show your support.

I did some searching for a tool to create JavaDoc-like documentation and found JSDoc at SourceForge.  I installed it on my server and ran the Spry JS files through it.  There were interesting results.  As it turns out, our friends over at Adobe have not been commenting in the JavaDoc style, which is to be expected if they're not writing it for this tool, specifically.

Kapsules has seen a lot of changes since the last version. The Widget Settings, Window and main Configuration dialogs were completely redesigned and new controls were added to make changing settings a breeze. Special attention was paid to widget developers and nearly every request from developers for new widget capabilities and features were implemented. Several widget-authoring aspects were completely redone from the ground up. Once again resource use and speed was paid special attention. More assistance and support for scripting languages were added to make use of the widgets, which use these alternative languages easier for users. Kapsules is a completely free, scriptable widget engine for Windows. Widgets are small application-like tools, which rest on your desktop. They can help make you more productive, display information, entertain your brain, or just give you something to smile at. Kapsules gives widget developers the choice of writing widgets eight different scripting languages including, but not limited to; JScript, VBScript, JScript.NET, VB.NET, Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby. Kapsules is free to download and free to use, so go ahead and give it a try.  Link - Getting Started Guide for New Users Link - Version History and Change List.Download -  Link  Click here to view link.2 Comments8 Referrals #1by  thomassenSun, September 18, 2005 4:45 PM Sounds good! #2by  thomassenSun, September 18, 2005 4:53 PM hey.

DLIST - The Impact of Open Access on Library and Information Science (A Research project)Home |Browse |Search |Credits |AboutRegister |User Area |DL-Harvest |HelpThe Impact of Open Access on Library and Information Science (A Research project)Malone, Cheryl Knott and Coleman, Anita Sundaram (2005) The Impact of Open Access on Library and Information Science (A Research project).Full text available as:PDF - Requires Adobe Acrobat Reader or other PDF viewer.AbstractThis is the text of a proposal (unfunded) submitted by Cheryl Knott Malone and Anita Coleman, School of Information Resources and Library Science, University of Arizona, Tucson to the IMLS National Leadership Grants 2005.To what extent does open access improve the impact of an article?  This is the deceptively simple question that we will investigate.  Our question is an important one if a clear understanding about the open access archive (OAA) phenomenon and what it means for our discipline, Library and Information Science (LIS) is ever to be achieved.  We will use DLIST as the testbed for answering our key research question.DLIST is the Digital Library for Information Science and Technology <http://dlist.sir.arizona.edu>, an OAA, where scholars can self-register and deposit research, education, and practice publications that center on cultural heritage institutions such as libraries, archives, and museums. DLIST was established in the summer of 2002 as a disciplinary repository for LIS.  DLIST runs on open source software, Eprints, and is compliant with Open Archives Initiative-Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH).  Thus DLIST is an interoperable data provider in the global chain of OAI repository services. Currently DLIST has about 500 users and 400 documents.  Usage of DLIST has grown from 41,156 hits in February 2004 to 112,728 hits in January 2005.  To answer the research question we will undertake the following activities over a period of three years.  In the first year we will 1) digitize articles from the back issues of the Journal of Education for Library and Information Science (JELIS), the premier journal for all matters related to library education; 1) conduct a citation study of JELIS articles to benchmark their research impact prior to deposit in DLIST, 2) deposit and create the metadata for digitized JELIS articles in DLIST; and 3) complete the writing of a DLIST User Guide and Self-Archiving Workshops manual.  In the second year of the project, we will 1) survey LIS faculty to determine a baseline of copyright awareness and scholarly communication behaviors related to self-archiving in the LIS education community, and 2) offer DLIST self-archiving workshops at four selected conferences.  The workshops will introduce scholars to OAA and how to self-archive using DLIST.  In the third year of the project, 1) participants who completed the DLIST workshops and surveys will be surveyed again, 2) a follow-up citation study to document citation rates and patterns of the digitized and deposited JELIS articles will be conducted, and 3) will be analyzed with usage of JELIS articles in DLIST to understand the impact of open access.  The goal of the second survey is to determine how behaviors may have changed and find out how the JELIS articles in DLIST, were used in ways that may not be revealed through mere citation data. This will contribute a richer understanding of impact than if we had only quantitative data from DLIST usage logs and citation rates and patterns (traditional research impact factors only) for JELIS.Current experience with DLIST has given us tantalizing evidence that open access to the JELIS articles will have an impact and that the nature of the impact will be diverse and rich, not just limited to research citations.  For example, informally gathered DLIST usage ‘nuggets’ are often about the usefulness of DLIST materials for classroom teaching (sometimes in a global context, as when we learned that it is used in a LIS school in Czechoslovakia) and networking among LIS teachers, researchers and practitioners. EPrint Type:OtherKeywords:Journal of Education for Library and Information Science; JELISSubjects:Scholarly CommunicationID Code:967Deposited On:10 November 2005Eprint Statistics:View statistics for this eprint1.

DLIST - Competing information realities: Digital libraries, repositories and the commonsHome |Browse |Search |Credits |AboutRegister |User Area |DL-Harvest |HelpCompeting information realities: Digital libraries, repositories and the commonsColeman, Anita Sundaram and Hastings, Samantha Kelly and Kraft, Donald H. and Rasmussen, Edie (2006) Competing information realities: Digital libraries, repositories and the commons.Full text available as:PDF - Requires Adobe Acrobat Reader or other PDF viewer.AbstractThis is a forthcoming panel at ASIS&T AM 2006, Nov. 6, 2006 (1:30 - 3:30 pm). Presenters: Donald Kraft, Louisiana State University & Editor, JASIST; Edie Rasmussen, University of British Columbia, Samantha Hastings, University of South Carolina & Editor, ASIS&T Monograph Series; and Anita Coleman, University of Arizona and Editor, dLIST. Sponsor:  SIG DL.The goal of the panel is to explore the concept of the commons by framing it in the context of scholarly communication while also honing our understandings about digital libraries and repositories as technologies and socio-cultural artifacts.  Panel members will uncover the pros and cons of the commons for LIS research and scholarly communication by describing the cognate and competing extant information realities.  Edie Rasmussen will discuss the role of digital libraries in the commons. Anita Coleman, dLIST editor, the first open access archive for the information sciences will present her latest research about open access archives and the commons.  Donald Kraft, Editor-in-chief of JASIST, will share his experiences editing a peer-reviewed ISI-ranked journal.  Samantha Hastings, editor of ASIS&T monographs will share book publishing plans and concerns.    This document contains brief overviews of the panel presentations together with the questions of each presenter for the audience/other panelists.

Presenters: Donald Kraft, Louisiana State University & Editor, JASIST; Edie Rasmussen, University of British Columbia, Samantha Hastings, University of South Carolina & Editor, ASIS&T Monograph Series; and Anita Coleman, University of Arizona and Editor, dLIST. Sponsor:  SIG DL.The goal of the panel is to explore the concept of the commons by framing it in the context of scholarly communication while also honing our understandings about digital libraries and repositories as technologies and socio-cultural artifacts.  Panel members will uncover the pros and cons of the commons for LIS research and scholarly communication by describing the cognate and competing extant information realities.  Edie Rasmussen will discuss the role of digital libraries in the commons. Anita Coleman, dLIST editor, the first open access archive for the information sciences will present her latest research about open access archives and the commons.  Donald Kraft, Editor-in-chief of JASIST, will share his experiences editing a peer-reviewed ISI-ranked journal.  Samantha Hastings, editor of ASIS&T monographs will share book publishing plans and concerns.    This document contains brief overviews of the panel presentations together with the questions of each presenter for the audience/other panelists.

Drug dealers reportedly used Cuba as a meeting place or refuge / Miami Herald - Cuba News / Noticias - CubaNet NewsCUBANET ...CUBANEWSOctober 19, 1999 Drug dealers reportedly used Cuba as a meeting place or refugeBy Gerardo Reyes, El Nuevo Herald Published Tuesday, October 19, 1999, in the Miami Herald Drug traffickers have recently been using Cuba to meet or seek refuge, according to information that has emerged from a string of narcotics arrests and scandals in Latin America this year.The latest case became known when the chief of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in Miami, Vincent Mazzilli, said the top leaders of a huge Colombian-Mexican drug smuggling consortium arrested last week had met at least once in Havana.Mazzilli said Colombia's Alejandro Bernal Madrigal and Mexico's Armando Valencia had met this year at a Cuban site he did not identify. They were indicted in Miami on charges of heading a network responsible for smuggling 20 to 30 tons of cocaine a month to the United States.The indictments were part of Operation Millennium, announced simultaneously by Attorney General Janet Reno in Washington, Colombian National Police Chief Rosso Jose Serrano in Bogota and Mazzilli in Miami.Mazzilli made a point of saying that the investigation had not implicated any Cubans and that the ``obvious reason for the meeting in Havana was that Cuba was ``outside the reach of U.S. and Colombian authorities.ALICE IN WONDERLAND Skeptics alleged that Cuban authorities must have known of the meeting.``In a country where every human rights activist, political dissident and journalist is followed, that narco-traffickers can meet without the Cuban secret police knowing is a tale from Alice in Wonderland, said Rep. Robert Menendez, D-N.J.Whatever the truth, it's clear that Bernal Madrigal and Valencia were not the first suspected drug traffickers to visit Cuba.Last month, a reputed member of Colombia's Medellin Cartel, Hector Dario Yepes, was arrested in Panama after he arrived on a flight from Havana. Extradited to Colombia, Yepes said he had been in Cuba as a tourist.And last April, two suspects in one of Peru's largest narcotics cases ever fled to Cuba after authorities seized 2.3 tons of cocaine hidden among boxes of fish in a shipping container in the Pacific port of Callao.Peruvian authorities identified the leaders of the smuggling plot as Boris Foguel y Suengas, 39, a Panamanian businessman, and Bruno Chiappe, a Peruvian auto broker.Chiappe later returned to Peru and turned himself in to police on the advice of his lawyer, Javier Corrochano, to take advantage of a law that offers lower penalties for criminals who confess and repent.HOTEL MEETING Corrochano told El Nuevo Herald that while in Cuba, Chiappe met with Foguel in a suite at the Melia Cohiba hotel in Havana, and that Foguel stayed regularly in a house in Havana that he shared with a Cuban girlfriend.``It is powerfully interesting to me that [Foguel] can walk around freely, Corrochano said. ``But since Interpol doesn't get much attention there. . . .Foguel, in an interview with the Lima news weekly Caretas reported to have taken place ``somewhere in Central America, said he had run an import-export business in Cuba for some years. Among the products he mentioned were prefabricated houses.Peruvian police have alleged that the Foguel-Chiappe group, nicknamed The Camels, laundered about $24 million through investments in buildings, luxury vehicles and bankrupt or fictitious enterprises.The Cuban government told Peruvian authorities that it had no record of any visit to the island by Foguel.Earlier this year, the Mexican newspaper Reforma reported that police believed that Mario Villanueva, a former governor of the state of Quintana Roo wanted on drug charges, was hiding in a small town near Havana.Mexican police also claim to have some evidence that Amado Carrillo, a powerful drug lord who died in 1997, visited Cuba several times beginning in 1994 and stayed in a government house reserved for important foreign visitors.Copyright 1999 Miami Herald  [BACK TO THE NEWS ]SECCIONESNOTICIAS...Prensa Independiente...Prensa Internacional...Prensa GubernamentalOTHER LANGUAGES...Spanish...German...FrenchINDEPENDIENTES...Cooperativas Agrícolas...Movimiento Sindical...Bibliotecas...MCL...AyunoDEL LECTOR...Letters...Cartas...Debate...OpiniónBUSQUEDAS...News Archive...News Search...Documents...LinksCULTURA...Painters...Photos of Cuba...Cigar LabelsCUBANET...Semanario...About Us...Informe 1998...E-MailCubaNet News, Inc.145 Madeira Ave, Suite 207Coral Gables, FL 33134(305) 774-1887#*#HTML PUBLIC "-//SQ//DTD HTML 2.0 + all extensions//EN" "hmpro3.dtd"#*#Drug dealers reportedly used Cuba as a meeting place or refuge / Miami Herald - Cuba News / Noticias - CubaNet NewsCUBANET ...CUBANEWSOctober 19, 1999 Drug dealers reportedly used Cuba as a meeting place or refugeBy Gerardo Reyes, El Nuevo Herald Published Tuesday, October 19, 1999, in the Miami Herald Drug traffickers have recently been using Cuba to meet or seek refuge, according to information that has emerged from a string of narcotics arrests and scandals in Latin America this year.The latest case became known when the chief of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in Miami, Vincent Mazzilli, said the top leaders of a huge Colombian-Mexican drug smuggling consortium arrested last week had met at least once in Havana.Mazzilli said Colombia's Alejandro Bernal Madrigal and Mexico's Armando Valencia had met this year at a Cuban site he did not identify.

Errol Chavez, DEA(AP) Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, Mexico's new No. 1 drug lord, rose to the top by eliminating rivals, winning over Colombian cocaine producers and evading a 19-month U.S.-Mexico effort to smash his smuggling syndicate, investigators told The Associated Press.Zambada is hardly a household name, yet he has become the most wanted drug smuggler in Mexico and is expected to be added soon to the FBI's Top 10 Most-Wanted Fugitives list, U.S. and Mexican drug agents told AP.Mexico's top anti-drug prosecutor, Jose Santiago Vasconcelos, called Zambada "drug dealer No. 1" and said the fugitive has become more powerful as his fellow kingpins have fallen, including one who was allegedly killed on Zambada's orders."With all the other groups, we have captured the leaders," Vasconcelos said at his heavily guarded Mexico City office. "He's the only leader we haven't caught."Zambada's organization was the target of "Operation Trifecta," a 19-month, U.S.-Mexican sting that ended July 31. Authorities say they collared 240 suspected drug smugglers in the United States and Mexico, seized nearly six tons of cocaine and unsealed U.S. federal indictments against Zambada, his son and his key cocaine distributor.Errol Chavez, head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's Arizona division, said the operation confirmed "the scope of (Zambada's) influence in Mexico is legendary," spanning nearly 30 years.Zambada, the 55-year-old leader of a drug gang based in the Pacific Coast resort city of Mazatlan, has formed alliances with "almost every known drug trafficking group in Mexico," Chavez said.No one knows exactly how much Mexico's drug trade - or Zambada's sizable share of it - are worth, but the White House estimates about half the $65 billion in narcotics that Americans buy each year comes through Mexico.Zambada has been charged with organized crime and drug trafficking in Mexico, and a U.S. indictment charges him with conspiring to smuggle cocaine.Zambada's rise to the top of Mexico's drug ranks began in February 2002, when police in Mazatlan shot and killed Ramon Arellano Felix. The feared enforcer for the Tijuana-based smuggling gang bearing his family's name, Arellano Felix had been on the list of the FBI's 10 most-wanted fugitives.Chavez and U.S. investigators in Mexico City who spoke on the condition of anonymity said Zambada lured Arellano Felix to his home turf and paid the police officers who killed him, although Mexican officials won't confirm that. Zambada has never been charged in the case.Zambada got another boost a month later, when authorities captured Ramon Arellano Felix's brother Benjamin, the Arellano Felix gang's operations chief.The Arellano Felix gang was Mexico's most powerful smuggling syndicate from the late 1990s until the death of Ramon Arellano Felix and the capture of Benjamin Arellano Felix.Many investigators on both sides of the border speculated that no one drug lord would step up and fill the power vacuum left by a weakened Arellano Felix gang.But Chavez said Zambada rose to power by winning the trust of Colombian cocaine producers in a way the Arellano Felix gang never could, allowing his organization to move more cocaine into the United States than most other smuggling syndicates."There were financial problems between the (Arellano Felix organization) and the Colombians," Chavez said, noting that as the Arellano Felix brothers fell, "bills went unpaid and the Colombians sought other trafficking organizations they trusted more.""They sought out El Mayo," he explained.Zambada formed close ties to a Colombian cocaine producing organization believed to be run by twin brothers Miguel and Victor Mejia Munera, U.S. investigators say.Arellano Felix syndicate smugglers still bring tons of cocaine into the United States via Tijuana. Rather than challenge the rival gang's authority between Baja California and California, Zambada has tightened his control of smuggling routes leading from neighboring Sonora state into Arizona, authorities say.Chavez said his office is stationing more DEA agents and informants in Sonora and southernmost Arizona in an effort to further target Zambada's group. The DEA also has received special funding for highway billboards between Tucson and Phoenix featuring a wanted poster of Zambada.Zambada remains a bitter enemy of the Arellano Felix gang, but is close to accused Juarez cartel leader Vicente Carrillo Fuentes and has reached out to Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, a convicted drug lord who escaped from prison and specializes in building drug tunnels under the U.S. border, authorities say."El Mayo is more of the businessman, the guy who wants to cooperate and bring people together," Chavez said. "He and El Chapo are very close. They have helped each other become very successful in Arizona."Originally from Sinaloa state where Mazatlan is located, Zambada got his start as an enforcer and hit man for the Juarez cartel based in the border city of the same name.Investigators can't agree on when he founded his own group of freelance smugglers. Mexico's attorney general's office still listed him as one of the heads of Juarez cartel's operations in Sinaloa as recently as 1998, but Chavez and other DEA officials said Zambada began working to form his own group in Mazatlan more than a decade ago.Mexico has taken out several top drug lords over the past two years. Besides the Arellano Felix brothers, police and soldiers collared Osiel Cardenas, the alleged head of the gulf cartel, in March. Last month, they caught up with Armando Valencia, one of thealleged heads of a drug gang based in the central state of Michoacan.Chavez said the DEA is watching family members Zambada has in the United States, but there's no evidence he has crossed the border. In August, Mexican special agents stormed homes in Sonora state's capital, Hermosillo, arresting one Zambada associate.Chavez said authorities were "one step away from El Chapo and two steps away from El Mayo.""It came down to timing," he said.

Under the 1999 Drug Kingpin Act, identified drug traffickers and their related businesses are denied access to the U.S. financial system and all trade and transactions involving U.S. companies and individuals.President Bush's action brings the number of designated people and entities to 48 since the first were made in 2000. Bush added to the list:Arellano Felix Organization, Eduardo Ramon Arellano Felix, Francisco Javier Arellano Felix, Carrillo Fuentes Organization and Armando Valencia Cornelio, all of Mexico.Also, Norris Nembhard and Leebert Ramcharan of Jamaica, Fernando Melciades Zevallos Gonzales of Peru, Iqbal Mirchi of India, and Haji Bashir Noorzai of Afghanistan."This action underscores the president's determination to do everything possible to pursue traffickers, undermine their operations and end the suffering that trade in illicit drugs inflicts on Americans and other people around the world, as well as preventing drug traffickers from supporting terrorists," White House deputy press secretary Scott McClellan said. ©2004 The Associated PressRelated Headlines Bush talks of economic progress, warns of...Bush Says Importing Drugs Makes SenseThree Admit Lying in Drug Settlement CaseBush mixes diplomacy, campaigning after...Bush Urges World to Unite With IraqTop Headlines Wednesday's Metals PricesBond Prices Mostly RiseCBS Names Panel to Probe Bush Guard StoryU.S.: Iraqi Prisoners Won't Be ReleasedSuicide Attack Kills 1 in Israel; 16 HurtUS/Nation HeadlinesBush, Annan Spar Over Iraq War at U.N.Insect Stings Kill Ex-Ind.
