Women Warriors - Sports - ClimbingClimbingScaling New Heights Climbing can be done on infinite scales ranging in location, terrain, difficulty and accessibility. No matter what the style, it has been defined as "gaining elevation through physical work." The sport first emerged in the late 19th century and was first practiced around the great mountain climbing centres in Germany, England, Austria and France. Two styles quickly developed: aid climbing, in which equipment was used for upward progress and for safety, and free climbing, where equipment was only for safety. Free climbing quickly branched out into various specialities, such as bouldering and indoor climbing.Two types of competitive climbing have emerged: classical and speed. In classical competition, the routes are designed to be difficult. The order of start is drawn by lot and climbers have between 30 seconds and a minute to choose a route and only 2 minutes to complete it. In speed competitions, climbers are timed as they climb identical walls at the same time. The one who reaches the top first wins. Sixteen-year-old Tori Allen from the U.S. is one of the best speed climbers in the world.Climbing done vertically is called 5th class climbing. This ranges from the easiest 5.6 to nearly impossible 5.15. Bouldering is a fairly new form of freestyle climbing. Instead of using a rope and traditional climbing equipment, bouldering climbers attempt short pieces of rock. A boulder "problem" is a particular sequence of moves or particular section of rock that requires climbing techniques and strength to ascend. The tallest boulder problems are 20 to 25 feet. Bouldering uses the V rating system, which goes from V0 to V14. Anything above V9 is extremely difficult. American Lisa Rands is one of the best women in bouldering today. Because bouldering rewards imagination and perseverance; not only a reliance on pure physical strength, but a challenge of your mental strength, it is making many fans of many women athletes. An ability to stay focused and calm is highly valued in this sport where one wrong move can prove costly.With the International Mountaineering and Climbing Federation (UIAA) governing the sport and an annual World Cup and world championships taking place every year, the sport is now scaling to new heights (pun intended). Up and coming athletes to pay attention to will be Alex Johnson and Meagan Martin, while Spaniard Josune Bereziartu continues to make her mark on the international climbing scene.Did you know ?34-year-old Abby Watkins, a native Australian, now making her home in British Columbia, has the women's speed record for the Nose of El Cap (16 hrs, 30 min.) and a medal for speed at the X Games?

Winter Hazards - Avalanche!What is an Avalanche?Snow is deposited in successive layers as the winter progresses. These layers may have dissimilar physical properties and an avalanche occurs when one layer slides on another (Surface Avalanche), or the whole snow cover slides on the ground (Full-Depth). An avalanche may be Dry or Wet, according to whether free water is present in the snow. It may be of Loose Snow, when the avalanche starts at a single point, or a Slab Avalanche, which occurs when an area of more cohesive snow separates from the surrounding snow and slides out.They Couldn't Get Out of the WayBy the time they wake Saturday morning, Parks Canada will have already posted its avalanche bulletin for backcountry skiers. In tree-line and alpine areas, the avalanche risk has been assessed as "considerable," the mid-range of the five possible ratings. Below the tree-line, the risk is assessed as "moderate," with natural avalanches unlikely. And the group of 14 high school students and three adults intend to stay below the tree line throughout their expedition. But the bulletin also refers to weak snow layers left over from early winter snowfalls that have failed to stabilize. The group makes its way to the Rogers Pass information building, a macaroni-shaped structure with a sod and timber roof, to pore over the latest information. Mr. Nicholson goes inside. He asks about conditions in several areas before heading back to the students and two other adults -- a fellow teacher and a chaperone. The group decides it is safe to ski that day. They ski through forest, along a rocky creek, over a snow-covered bridge and into the Connaught Creek valley. Surrounded by mountains and deep powder snow, the scenery is breathtaking. Reminders of past avalanches are everywhere. Foliage is sparse on the valley floor. The school group successfully crosses four avalanche-prone paths on the north side of the valley, and three on the south side. It's a soft, grey morning. The ground is blanketed by eight centimetres of fresh snow. The temperature hovers around zero. The past 24 hours have been avalanche-free, and Abby Watkins and Rich Marshall are eager to get in a day of backcountry skiing amid the mountainous sweep near the summit of Rogers Pass in eastern British Columbia. They are not alone. The mountain guides spot a school group getting ready to press ahead into the popular Balu Pass. Husband and wife pause to say hello. "It's a beautiful day out here, isn't it?" says Abby. "Yes," someone responds. They leave the 14 teenagers and three adults behind, climbing briskly until they stop for a break in a treed area. At that very moment, just before noon, something gives way on the rugged north face of Cheops Mountain. Abby and Rich hear a thunderous roar. They watch in horror as a torrent of snow hurtles to the valley, picking up speed and debris. The school group is directly in its path. Rich screams: "Avalanche! Avalanche! Avalanche!" The skiers look up. The guide's frantic warning comes too late. The avalanche hits them head on.In a matter of seconds, all 17 skiers are swept away in a huge, terrifying tangle of snow, rocks and trees. The swiftness and power of the avalanche sounds like a freight train moving at high speeds, Abby thinks. "A huge roar. The power of that much snow moving at the acceleration of gravity and propagating more and more snow on the way. . . . Nobody could have got out of the way. Nobody." Students mourn the loss of their friendsThe river-rush of snow engulfs the skiers, then separates them. A section of the slide breaks away and keeps going, carrying a number of victims hundreds of metres down the valley. Disoriented and tumbling head over foot with little chance to "swim" to the surface, this unlucky group ends up as much as 4.5 metres beneath the concrete-hard snow. Up in the trees, Abby Watkins and Rich Marshall are dusted by a thick cloud of powder. A terrible silence falls over the valley. Though their hearts are thumping, they shut down their emotions. On goes the search-and-rescue switch, one they have trained for years to put into practice. They race down to the first group of buried skiers. The only sign of life is an odd hand and a few legs poking through the snow. The others, in the toe of the slide at the bottom of the valley, are buried much deeper. Alone at the scene, the husband-and-wife team is faced with heartbreaking decisions. Who to save first? Not everybody would make it, they reason. But those trapped near the top would have a better shot at survival. Rich runs for the first hand he sees and begins digging. For the next 45 minutes, except for the victims, Rich and Abby are there by themselves, working to free as many as they can from their tombs of suffocating snow. The guides' transceivers work perfectly, honing in with beeps and flashing lights on the buried skiers equipped with their own avalanche beacons, like shouts from the grave. The couple follows the rules of avalanche rescue like clockwork. Only dig to a victim to make sure he or she is breathing. Clear snow from the victim's face. No CPR before moving on to the next victim. There are too many. Let survivors dig themselves out. The victims are scattered beneath the snow. Rich and Abby split up to cover as much ground as possible. The first five people they pull out survive. Those survivors go on to rescue others. Everyone else Abby and Rich uncover is dead. The grim lottery of who shall live and who shall die is over. Seven students make it. Seven do not. One survivor, with a broken ankle, is tobogganed out and airlifted to hospital. The remaining survivors are transported by helicopter to the cafeteria of the park warden's station. The bodies go too. They are laid out on mats in a makeshift morgue in the same building. Chuck Purse, Revelstoke's part-time coroner, is investigating his second seven-death avalanche within two weeks. He examines each body in turn. None show signs of major injury. They were simply swept away, buried and died from asphyxiation.Loose snow tumbles down the mountainA slab avalanche breaks off the mountainA car is swept away by a tidal wave of snowWhat Do I Do If...I GET CAUGHT: In most avalanche situations, any defensive action is very difficult. Movement relative to the debris is often impossible. However, some of the following may be useful:Try to delay departure by plunging an ice axe into the undersurface. This may help to keep you near the top of the slideShout. Others may see you.Try to run to the side, or jump up-slope above the fractureIf hard slab, try to remain on top of a block.Get rid of gear; sacks, skis etc.Try to roll like a log, off the debris.Swimming motions sometimes help.As the avalanche slows down, you may be able to get some purchase on the debris. Make a desperate effort to get to the surface, or at least get a hand through.I'M BURIED: Keep one hand in front of you face and try to clear/maintain an air space.Try to maintain space for chest expansion by taking and holding a deep breath.Try to avoid panic and conserve energy. Your companions are probably searching for you.Try to dig yourself out if you are unhurt. The next number that works against you is the length of burial. A speedy location and recovery of the buried victim is essential as the survival rate drops to 50% after 20 minutes.An avalanche occurs on Mt. Everest.A mountain climber treads carefully.Skiiers are particularly vulnerable to triggering an avalanche, as the lateral motion releases unstable snow.Avalanche Rescue EquipmentThe best strategy for surviving an avalanche is to avoid being caught in one. All backcountry skiers and boarders should be trained in avalanche awareness and should be knowledgeable about the conditions and terrain they're entering. The following rescue equipment should be in everyone's backpack and the skills for using it should be readily accessible in everyone's head:TransceiversAvalanche transceivers (also known as beacons) are designed to help a rescuer locate a buried victim in the least amount of time possible. Although most beacons in use today are fairly intuitive to operate, it is important to practice using them on a regular basis.ProbesThe only way to penetrate dense, compacted avalanche debris is to use a multi-sectioned aluminium pole known as an avalanche probe. They extend two to three metres long, and are held in tension with a cable. When a searcher with a beacon has honed in on a buried person, other members of the party should probe the snowpack for the exact location of the victim. (You cannot pinpoint a person who is deeply buried using only a beacon.) The probe is left in contact with the victim until they have been exposed by shovelling. Probes also have other uses, such as checking snowpack depth, and testing crevasse bridges and cornices while travelling. For this reason, they are currently carried by most travellers and are recommended over probe poles.ShovelsFinding the location of a victim is only the first part of the rescue  digging them out is the second critical step. In the seconds after an avalanche, even fresh powder will solidify so densely that you cannot push your hand into it. There are many different types of avalanche shovels. The more high-tech models have telescoping handles that extend to give better leverage when shovelling. Some store saws or probes in their handles. Metal blades chop debris better than lexan or polycarbonate, and the bigger the blade, the more snow you can move with each scoop. The important thing about shovels is that everybody in your group has one. It is also worth practising excavation in a team of two or three to learn to shovel effectively as a group.Beautiful Roger's Pass, B.C. is the site of a tragic accident that claimed the lives of 7 students.Avalanches claimed the lives of 28 Canadians in 2002-2003. That number declined in 2003-2004 to 10 fatalitiesSliding Into OblivionFormer Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's youngest son, Michel, was killed in an avalanche in 1998No one knows how quickly Michel Trudeau realized he was going to die Nov. 14, 1998, when a wall of wet snow sent him tumbling down a southern B.C. mountainside into ice cold Kokanee Lake.A springtime view of Kokanee Lake, where Michel still restsThe youngest son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau spent several minutes in the water, fighting to remove his heavy backpack and touring skis, all the while "shouting for help and groaning," eyewitness Eric Lemieux told reporters later.'We could see him," said Lemieux, one of several skiers following Trudeau when the avalanche struck. "We knew it was going to be a slow and painful death. But we couldn't reach him. He was in the middle of the lake."Trudeau, 23, eventually sank out of sight - leaving behind one of Canada's most famous families to grieve without a casket. Scuba divers have failed to find Trudeau's body in the glacier-fed lake in Kootenay Glacier Provincial Park, about 300 kilometres southwest of Calgary. The Trudeaus did not push search and rescue teams to locate Michel's body. Says Justin Trudeau, Michel's older brother, of his final resting place in Kokanee Lake; "It's glorious. It's one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen. That's where he was destined to be."Trudeau had lived in the area for a year, working as a ski lift attendant at Red Mountain, near Rossland. He was a fun-loving young man, who enjoyed the outdoors, and had traveled out West after graduating from university. Since Michel's death, the Trudeau family has been working closely with the Canadian Avalanche Association to promote avalanche safety. Young Michel with his famous father.Michel with his best buddy Makwa, the summer before his death.In The Wrong Place at The Wrong TimeA New Hampshire man was killed on November 10, 1998 after he triggered an avalanche on the upper mountain of a closed ski area in Utah. Jeff Clement, 21, was snowboarding with four friends in Little Cottonwood Canyon, between the Alta and Snowbird ski areas, when the incident occurred."It was reported that he was the last to start down and he's the one who broke it loose," Captain Gil Howard, of the Salt Lake Country Sheriff's Office, said. "It was a way unstable area."The problem was they were in a ski area, but they were faced with backcountry conditions..." Sgt. Gil Howard, Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office"All five were buried to one extent or another," Howard said, "and he was the only one completely buried." The other four were able to extract themselves, but Clement was buried with his board uphill. Carrying no beacons or shovels, the friends reportedly did everything they could to locate Clement but were unsuccessful.Clement's body was found by an Alta rescue dog, but a heavy storm predicted for the area Saturday night forced rescuers to abandon the recovery effort.Returning the next day during snows, rescuers "shocked the mountain" to release unstable snow and safely removed the body. Clement was originally buried under three feet of snow. Though not officially determined, Howard said it appeared Clement may have died from severe head trauma."The problem was they were in a ski area, but they were faced with backcountry conditions. They are lulled into a false sense, but there's no control work done and this is the tragic outcome," Howard said. Howard said he has heard there were upwards of 50 people in the area that day. Clement and his friends "were just in the wrong area on the wrong day and at the wrong time," he said.Howard said the five friends had hiked the ridgeline from Alta ski area onto Mt. Baldy. Not yet open for the season, the upper mountain, Howard said, is a popular pre-season destination for adventurous skiers and snowboarders. But, without any controls yet done on the mountain, avalanche danger was extremely high and the fact that the area was closed is well posted."They had to hike quite a bit to get up there," Howard said, "but it's not atypical. It's a hard way to learn, but if we can prevent it from happening again, then there's a small amount of good that comes from it." Howard said it is imperative people learn about snow conditions and snow safety, as well as carry emergency equipment.Contributing FactorsWeatherThis is the most important factor in determining whether avalanches are likely and the evolution of the snowpack is entirely dependent on this. Many weather variables affect avalanche release and information can often be gained before setting out. A sudden temperature rise may indicate a hazard, as the nearer the snow gets to zero degrees celsius, the more dangerous it is. Remember: 90% of all avalanches occur during a snowstorm. SnowpacksWhen visibility is adequate, snowpack observation can begin from the roadside. Evidence of recent avalanche activity, main snow accumulation zones, fresh loading by new snow and drifting, can often be noted from below. Observations can continue on the approach, noting such details as depth of foot penetration, cornice build-up, ease of release of small slabs and the effect which localised wind patterns may have had on slab formation. Any suspect slopes which must be negotiated (bearing in mind that the safest course is to avoid them) may be tested by digging a snowpit. Pits should not initially be dug on the main suspect slope, but on small, safe slopes of similar orientation. The following features should be looked for:Adjacent layers of different hardness (difference of more than 2 on scale of 5)Very soft layers (fist penetrates easily)Water drops squeezed out of a snowball made from any layerLayers of iceLayers of graupel (rounded, heavily rimed pellets) - these act like a layer of ball-bearings in the snowpackFeathery or faceted crystalsLayers of loose, uncohesive grainsAir spaceAny of the above may be the source of a dangerous weakness in the snowpack.Travel in Hazard AreasIf it is essential to proceed, the following should be borne in mind:Solo travellers in avalanche terrain run particularly grave hazardsSkiers are in greater danger than walkers - the lateral cutting action of skis readily releases unstable snow. All off-piste skiers should use avalanche transceivers and have them SWITCHED ON before leaving base. They should carry collapsible probes and shovels. Climbers and walkers should consider the use of these items.Direct descent or ascent is safer than traversing.Go one at a time - the others should closely observe the progress of the person on the suspect slope.Close up clothing, wrap scarf or other item round mouth and nose.90% OF AVALANCHES INVOLVING HUMAN SUBJECTS ARE TRIGGERED BY THEIR VICTIMS.Safe Travel Practices· Follow terrain features that are least likely to avalanche. Use ridges and areas where the snow has been blown off to ascend or descend.· Avoid traversing under avalanche slopes. If natural avalanches are likely (high or extreme hazard) or any time there are "whomping'" sounds in the snowpack.· Traverse slopes as high as possible. Whenever crossing a potential avalanche slope, cross as high as possible so as to have as little snow to bury you as possible. Watch out for a falling hazard.· When traversing slopes travel one at a time. Two reasons for this, one is to avoid having more than one person caught in an avalanche the other is to minimize the load on the slope.· Avoid climbing under another person. Avalanches can be triggered by the other party often with little consequence to them and burying you.· Travel one at a time from safe zone to safe zone when ascending or descending gullies. Look for alcoves or walls that will protect you should your partner kick off a small avalanche.· Use belaying techniques when climbing gullies that have avalanche hazard. We are often told not to rope up in avalanche terrain, but when rock or ice protection is available that will not slide with the slope, the rope can keep you from being carried away by the avalanche. This can protect you from small localized avalanches.· Watch for terrain traps. Make sure that should you be involved in an avalanche, the debris will not be trapped and cause a small slide to have a deep debris pile.· Watch for the falling hazard even when crossing the most benign looking slopes. Even the smallest of avalanches can be deadly when mixed with a cliff band. This can be important between ice bulges or on ridges.· Always wear an avalanche transceiver and carry a shovel and probe.A search dog locates a buried victim. Once a victim is completely buried there is only a 1 in 3 chance of survival. #*#html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"#*#Winter Hazards - Avalanche!What is an Avalanche?Snow is deposited in successive layers as the winter progresses.

It may be of Loose Snow, when the avalanche starts at a single point, or a Slab Avalanche, which occurs when an area of more cohesive snow separates from the surrounding snow and slides out.They Couldn't Get Out of the WayBy the time they wake Saturday morning, Parks Canada will have already posted its avalanche bulletin for backcountry skiers. In tree-line and alpine areas, the avalanche risk has been assessed as "considerable," the mid-range of the five possible ratings. Below the tree-line, the risk is assessed as "moderate," with natural avalanches unlikely. And the group of 14 high school students and three adults intend to stay below the tree line throughout their expedition. But the bulletin also refers to weak snow layers left over from early winter snowfalls that have failed to stabilize. The group makes its way to the Rogers Pass information building, a macaroni-shaped structure with a sod and timber roof, to pore over the latest information. Mr. Nicholson goes inside. He asks about conditions in several areas before heading back to the students and two other adults -- a fellow teacher and a chaperone. The group decides it is safe to ski that day. They ski through forest, along a rocky creek, over a snow-covered bridge and into the Connaught Creek valley. Surrounded by mountains and deep powder snow, the scenery is breathtaking. Reminders of past avalanches are everywhere. Foliage is sparse on the valley floor. The school group successfully crosses four avalanche-prone paths on the north side of the valley, and three on the south side. It's a soft, grey morning. The ground is blanketed by eight centimetres of fresh snow. The temperature hovers around zero. The past 24 hours have been avalanche-free, and Abby Watkins and Rich Marshall are eager to get in a day of backcountry skiing amid the mountainous sweep near the summit of Rogers Pass in eastern British Columbia. They are not alone. The mountain guides spot a school group getting ready to press ahead into the popular Balu Pass. Husband and wife pause to say hello. "It's a beautiful day out here, isn't it?" says Abby. "Yes," someone responds. They leave the 14 teenagers and three adults behind, climbing briskly until they stop for a break in a treed area. At that very moment, just before noon, something gives way on the rugged north face of Cheops Mountain. Abby and Rich hear a thunderous roar. They watch in horror as a torrent of snow hurtles to the valley, picking up speed and debris. The school group is directly in its path. Rich screams: "Avalanche! Avalanche! Avalanche!" The skiers look up. The guide's frantic warning comes too late. The avalanche hits them head on.In a matter of seconds, all 17 skiers are swept away in a huge, terrifying tangle of snow, rocks and trees. The swiftness and power of the avalanche sounds like a freight train moving at high speeds, Abby thinks. "A huge roar. The power of that much snow moving at the acceleration of gravity and propagating more and more snow on the way. . . . Nobody could have got out of the way. Nobody." Students mourn the loss of their friendsThe river-rush of snow engulfs the skiers, then separates them. A section of the slide breaks away and keeps going, carrying a number of victims hundreds of metres down the valley. Disoriented and tumbling head over foot with little chance to "swim" to the surface, this unlucky group ends up as much as 4.5 metres beneath the concrete-hard snow. Up in the trees, Abby Watkins and Rich Marshall are dusted by a thick cloud of powder. A terrible silence falls over the valley. Though their hearts are thumping, they shut down their emotions. On goes the search-and-rescue switch, one they have trained for years to put into practice. They race down to the first group of buried skiers. The only sign of life is an odd hand and a few legs poking through the snow. The others, in the toe of the slide at the bottom of the valley, are buried much deeper. Alone at the scene, the husband-and-wife team is faced with heartbreaking decisions. Who to save first? Not everybody would make it, they reason. But those trapped near the top would have a better shot at survival. Rich runs for the first hand he sees and begins digging. For the next 45 minutes, except for the victims, Rich and Abby are there by themselves, working to free as many as they can from their tombs of suffocating snow. The guides' transceivers work perfectly, honing in with beeps and flashing lights on the buried skiers equipped with their own avalanche beacons, like shouts from the grave. The couple follows the rules of avalanche rescue like clockwork. Only dig to a victim to make sure he or she is breathing. Clear snow from the victim's face. No CPR before moving on to the next victim. There are too many. Let survivors dig themselves out. The victims are scattered beneath the snow. Rich and Abby split up to cover as much ground as possible. The first five people they pull out survive. Those survivors go on to rescue others. Everyone else Abby and Rich uncover is dead. The grim lottery of who shall live and who shall die is over. Seven students make it. Seven do not. One survivor, with a broken ankle, is tobogganed out and airlifted to hospital. The remaining survivors are transported by helicopter to the cafeteria of the park warden's station. The bodies go too. They are laid out on mats in a makeshift morgue in the same building. Chuck Purse, Revelstoke's part-time coroner, is investigating his second seven-death avalanche within two weeks. He examines each body in turn. None show signs of major injury. They were simply swept away, buried and died from asphyxiation.Loose snow tumbles down the mountainA slab avalanche breaks off the mountainA car is swept away by a tidal wave of snowWhat Do I Do If...I GET CAUGHT: In most avalanche situations, any defensive action is very difficult. Movement relative to the debris is often impossible. However, some of the following may be useful:Try to delay departure by plunging an ice axe into the undersurface. This may help to keep you near the top of the slideShout. Others may see you.Try to run to the side, or jump up-slope above the fractureIf hard slab, try to remain on top of a block.Get rid of gear; sacks, skis etc.Try to roll like a log, off the debris.Swimming motions sometimes help.As the avalanche slows down, you may be able to get some purchase on the debris. Make a desperate effort to get to the surface, or at least get a hand through.I'M BURIED: Keep one hand in front of you face and try to clear/maintain an air space.Try to maintain space for chest expansion by taking and holding a deep breath.Try to avoid panic and conserve energy. Your companions are probably searching for you.Try to dig yourself out if you are unhurt. The next number that works against you is the length of burial. A speedy location and recovery of the buried victim is essential as the survival rate drops to 50% after 20 minutes.An avalanche occurs on Mt. Everest.A mountain climber treads carefully.Skiiers are particularly vulnerable to triggering an avalanche, as the lateral motion releases unstable snow.Avalanche Rescue EquipmentThe best strategy for surviving an avalanche is to avoid being caught in one. All backcountry skiers and boarders should be trained in avalanche awareness and should be knowledgeable about the conditions and terrain they're entering. The following rescue equipment should be in everyone's backpack and the skills for using it should be readily accessible in everyone's head:TransceiversAvalanche transceivers (also known as beacons) are designed to help a rescuer locate a buried victim in the least amount of time possible. Although most beacons in use today are fairly intuitive to operate, it is important to practice using them on a regular basis.ProbesThe only way to penetrate dense, compacted avalanche debris is to use a multi-sectioned aluminium pole known as an avalanche probe. They extend two to three metres long, and are held in tension with a cable. When a searcher with a beacon has honed in on a buried person, other members of the party should probe the snowpack for the exact location of the victim. (You cannot pinpoint a person who is deeply buried using only a beacon.) The probe is left in contact with the victim until they have been exposed by shovelling. Probes also have other uses, such as checking snowpack depth, and testing crevasse bridges and cornices while travelling. For this reason, they are currently carried by most travellers and are recommended over probe poles.ShovelsFinding the location of a victim is only the first part of the rescue  digging them out is the second critical step. In the seconds after an avalanche, even fresh powder will solidify so densely that you cannot push your hand into it. There are many different types of avalanche shovels. The more high-tech models have telescoping handles that extend to give better leverage when shovelling. Some store saws or probes in their handles. Metal blades chop debris better than lexan or polycarbonate, and the bigger the blade, the more snow you can move with each scoop. The important thing about shovels is that everybody in your group has one. It is also worth practising excavation in a team of two or three to learn to shovel effectively as a group.Beautiful Roger's Pass, B.C. is the site of a tragic accident that claimed the lives of 7 students.Avalanches claimed the lives of 28 Canadians in 2002-2003. That number declined in 2003-2004 to 10 fatalitiesSliding Into OblivionFormer Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's youngest son, Michel, was killed in an avalanche in 1998No one knows how quickly Michel Trudeau realized he was going to die Nov. 14, 1998, when a wall of wet snow sent him tumbling down a southern B.C. mountainside into ice cold Kokanee Lake.A springtime view of Kokanee Lake, where Michel still restsThe youngest son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau spent several minutes in the water, fighting to remove his heavy backpack and touring skis, all the while "shouting for help and groaning," eyewitness Eric Lemieux told reporters later.'We could see him," said Lemieux, one of several skiers following Trudeau when the avalanche struck. "We knew it was going to be a slow and painful death. But we couldn't reach him. He was in the middle of the lake."Trudeau, 23, eventually sank out of sight - leaving behind one of Canada's most famous families to grieve without a casket. Scuba divers have failed to find Trudeau's body in the glacier-fed lake in Kootenay Glacier Provincial Park, about 300 kilometres southwest of Calgary. The Trudeaus did not push search and rescue teams to locate Michel's body. Says Justin Trudeau, Michel's older brother, of his final resting place in Kokanee Lake; "It's glorious. It's one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen. That's where he was destined to be."Trudeau had lived in the area for a year, working as a ski lift attendant at Red Mountain, near Rossland. He was a fun-loving young man, who enjoyed the outdoors, and had traveled out West after graduating from university. Since Michel's death, the Trudeau family has been working closely with the Canadian Avalanche Association to promote avalanche safety. Young Michel with his famous father.Michel with his best buddy Makwa, the summer before his death.In The Wrong Place at The Wrong TimeA New Hampshire man was killed on November 10, 1998 after he triggered an avalanche on the upper mountain of a closed ski area in Utah. Jeff Clement, 21, was snowboarding with four friends in Little Cottonwood Canyon, between the Alta and Snowbird ski areas, when the incident occurred."It was reported that he was the last to start down and he's the one who broke it loose," Captain Gil Howard, of the Salt Lake Country Sheriff's Office, said. "It was a way unstable area."The problem was they were in a ski area, but they were faced with backcountry conditions..." Sgt. Gil Howard, Salt Lake County Sheriff's Office"All five were buried to one extent or another," Howard said, "and he was the only one completely buried." The other four were able to extract themselves, but Clement was buried with his board uphill. Carrying no beacons or shovels, the friends reportedly did everything they could to locate Clement but were unsuccessful.Clement's body was found by an Alta rescue dog, but a heavy storm predicted for the area Saturday night forced rescuers to abandon the recovery effort.Returning the next day during snows, rescuers "shocked the mountain" to release unstable snow and safely removed the body. Clement was originally buried under three feet of snow. Though not officially determined, Howard said it appeared Clement may have died from severe head trauma."The problem was they were in a ski area, but they were faced with backcountry conditions. They are lulled into a false sense, but there's no control work done and this is the tragic outcome," Howard said. Howard said he has heard there were upwards of 50 people in the area that day. Clement and his friends "were just in the wrong area on the wrong day and at the wrong time," he said.Howard said the five friends had hiked the ridgeline from Alta ski area onto Mt. Baldy. Not yet open for the season, the upper mountain, Howard said, is a popular pre-season destination for adventurous skiers and snowboarders. But, without any controls yet done on the mountain, avalanche danger was extremely high and the fact that the area was closed is well posted."They had to hike quite a bit to get up there," Howard said, "but it's not atypical. It's a hard way to learn, but if we can prevent it from happening again, then there's a small amount of good that comes from it." Howard said it is imperative people learn about snow conditions and snow safety, as well as carry emergency equipment.Contributing FactorsWeatherThis is the most important factor in determining whether avalanches are likely and the evolution of the snowpack is entirely dependent on this. Many weather variables affect avalanche release and information can often be gained before setting out. A sudden temperature rise may indicate a hazard, as the nearer the snow gets to zero degrees celsius, the more dangerous it is. Remember: 90% of all avalanches occur during a snowstorm. SnowpacksWhen visibility is adequate, snowpack observation can begin from the roadside. Evidence of recent avalanche activity, main snow accumulation zones, fresh loading by new snow and drifting, can often be noted from below. Observations can continue on the approach, noting such details as depth of foot penetration, cornice build-up, ease of release of small slabs and the effect which localised wind patterns may have had on slab formation. Any suspect slopes which must be negotiated (bearing in mind that the safest course is to avoid them) may be tested by digging a snowpit. Pits should not initially be dug on the main suspect slope, but on small, safe slopes of similar orientation. The following features should be looked for:Adjacent layers of different hardness (difference of more than 2 on scale of 5)Very soft layers (fist penetrates easily)Water drops squeezed out of a snowball made from any layerLayers of iceLayers of graupel (rounded, heavily rimed pellets) - these act like a layer of ball-bearings in the snowpackFeathery or faceted crystalsLayers of loose, uncohesive grainsAir spaceAny of the above may be the source of a dangerous weakness in the snowpack.Travel in Hazard AreasIf it is essential to proceed, the following should be borne in mind:Solo travellers in avalanche terrain run particularly grave hazardsSkiers are in greater danger than walkers - the lateral cutting action of skis readily releases unstable snow. All off-piste skiers should use avalanche transceivers and have them SWITCHED ON before leaving base. They should carry collapsible probes and shovels. Climbers and walkers should consider the use of these items.Direct descent or ascent is safer than traversing.Go one at a time - the others should closely observe the progress of the person on the suspect slope.Close up clothing, wrap scarf or other item round mouth and nose.90% OF AVALANCHES INVOLVING HUMAN SUBJECTS ARE TRIGGERED BY THEIR VICTIMS.Safe Travel Practices· Follow terrain features that are least likely to avalanche. Use ridges and areas where the snow has been blown off to ascend or descend.· Avoid traversing under avalanche slopes. If natural avalanches are likely (high or extreme hazard) or any time there are "whomping'" sounds in the snowpack.· Traverse slopes as high as possible. Whenever crossing a potential avalanche slope, cross as high as possible so as to have as little snow to bury you as possible. Watch out for a falling hazard.· When traversing slopes travel one at a time. Two reasons for this, one is to avoid having more than one person caught in an avalanche the other is to minimize the load on the slope.· Avoid climbing under another person. Avalanches can be triggered by the other party often with little consequence to them and burying you.· Travel one at a time from safe zone to safe zone when ascending or descending gullies. Look for alcoves or walls that will protect you should your partner kick off a small avalanche.· Use belaying techniques when climbing gullies that have avalanche hazard. We are often told not to rope up in avalanche terrain, but when rock or ice protection is available that will not slide with the slope, the rope can keep you from being carried away by the avalanche. This can protect you from small localized avalanches.· Watch for terrain traps. Make sure that should you be involved in an avalanche, the debris will not be trapped and cause a small slide to have a deep debris pile.· Watch for the falling hazard even when crossing the most benign looking slopes. Even the smallest of avalanches can be deadly when mixed with a cliff band. This can be important between ice bulges or on ridges.· Always wear an avalanche transceiver and carry a shovel and probe.A search dog locates a buried victim. Once a victim is completely buried there is only a 1 in 3 chance of survival. #*#

Avalanche Incident (CSAC) - Canada, February 2, 2003Avalanche Incident, 2002-2003 SeasonDateLocationActivityKilledInjuredBulletinFeb 01CanadaSkiing710 (minor) [Photos] [Media Reports][Official Reports] [Other Sources]PhotosTopo Map segment showing location in relation to Hwy 1 and Rogers PassNewspaper photo of slide area and slide runoutMedia ReportsSeven skiers dead in second deadly B.C. avalanche in a monthREVELSTOKE, B.C. (CP) - Seven teens on a high-school ski excursion in the back country of east-central B.C. died Saturday when a half-kilometre-wide avalanche came down from above them and engulfed their group. It was the second deadly slide to hit the region in as many weeks. Seven adults perished in a slide in January. The dead were six boys and one girl, all in Grade 10 at Strathcona-Tweedsmuir School, a private day school on an expansive rural campus in the foothills southwest of Calgary."We are absolutely stricken with grief. Our hearts go out to all those who are impacted," Tony Macoun, head of the school, said in a written statement. Frantic parents gathered at the school Saturday night, arriving separately and in groups, embracing each other. No students were visible. "Our school is a small family and loss this extreme is impacting us tremendously," said Macoun. There were 17 people in the school group, three adults and 14 Grade 10 students in an outdoor education class, on their annual cross-country ski trip.The avalanche occurred on Mount Cheops in Glacier National Park just before noon, said Pam Doyle, superintendent for Parks Canada in Revelstoke.It happened on the north face of the mountain in Connaught Creek Valley section of Balu Valley, about five kilometres west of the Rogers Pass summit. The group was led by two male teachers and a male volunteer. All had certification and back-country experience, Macoun said. The group had been skiing about 15 metres apart, with one supervisor in front and the other two bringing up the rear. The skiers were halfway up the valley when the avalanche roared down the north slope, burying nearly the entire group.Another group of young skiers witnessed the avalanche and were among the first to help. A supervisor whose hand was just visible above the snow was the first to	be dug out. Once freed, he called park wardens on a satellite phone to raise the alarm. "Of the remaining students, six of the students are safe and one has a broken ankle," Macoun said in his statement.The three leaders were uninjured and are attending to the survivors, who were in Revelstoke on Saturday night after being airlifted first to Glacier Park Lodge by helicopter. Two people from the group were treated for minor injuries, said RCMP Sgt. Randy Brown.The avalanche was "very powerful," with a rating from 3 to 3.5, compared with a top rating of 4, said Pat Dunn, a Parks Canada spokeswoman. "The size 3 to 3.5 avalanche could destroy a building . . . or 10 acres of forest," she said. The slide was 500 to 800 metres wide and travelled a kilometre down the slope. Some of the skiers were buried as deep as three metres, said Dunn.She said the group was carrying the proper avalanche-rescue equipment, including personal locator beacons and digging tools.A park conditions bulletin said there was a considerable avalanche hazard	in the area Saturday. That rating is about the middle of the hazard scale but includes the high probability that a person could trigger a slide, said Dunn. "The risk always varies . . . when the risk is posted as considerable it's a note to skiers to be cautious," she said."There are a couple of instabilities in our snow pack this winter . . .that may have contributed and further investigation will determine (that)."Saturday's slide was unusually deadly, said Eric Dafoe, public safety officer with Parks Canada in Revelstoke. "We've never had an avalanche like this where we had a multiple number ofpeople buried," said Dafoe, who worked on the rescue effort and flew over the slide as part the initial investigation.  "It was a huge slide," he said. "It covered the valley floor from side to side." Dafoe said the slide began at a point between 2,200 to 2,300 vertical metres up Mount Cheops. It travelled for a kilometre and spread out half a kilometre at the sides. The toe of the slide ended at about the 1,500-metre elevation mark with parts of it more than five metres deep.Dafoe said the investigation will continue but was almost certain it was a natural slide. "It (the slide trigger site) is so far from the bottom it seems unlikely it was human-triggered," he said. Dafoe speculated a small slide may have occurred high up the mountain and as it came down, it dragged out snow from surrounding gullies.Park wardens, RCMP officers and local ski tour operators and guides, backed up by four or five helicopters and search dogs, joined in the rescue effort. Members of a Canadian Horse Artillery unit stationed in the park for avalanche-control work were also on hand to assist.Ruedi Beglinger, owner of Selkirk Mountain Experience and organizer of the fatal expedition last month, was with his clients when it struck. Contacted Saturday night, Beglinger did not want to comment on the level of experience necessary to ski the area where the students were caught. "There is an inherent risk (in back-country skiing) which is very important to talk about, an inherent risk people have to be willing to share amongst themselves (whether) they have a guide or not," he said.The area of Saturday's slide is not particularly remote, but Dunn said there were no groomed trails, "except people who have been there before you." But no guides are needed to ski in the area and skiers do not have to register before setting off. "It's a very, very popular ski destination site," said Dunn, media liaison officer at the national park.Brown said the skiers were not part of a commercial tour group.Doyle said that at this time there are no plans yet to close back-country areas of the park. Official ReportsAvalanche Tragedy in Glacier National Parkby: Doreen McGillis, Parks Canada(Published in the "Avalanche News" of the Canadian Avalanche Association)On February 1, 2003, a huge avalanche swept into the Connaught Creek drainage of Glacier National Park and into the awareness of millions of Canadians. This avalanche accident attracted the attention of the nation. The seven victims of this avalanche were 15-year olds on a school field trip, and the accident happened less than two weeks after an avalanche that killed seven skiers in an area only 40 kilometres away.All 17 skiers in the school group were caught in this avalanche, either partially or fully buried, and 10 survived. Two Association of Canadian Mountain Guides (ACMG) members were above this party, heard and saw the avalanche across the valley and tried to warn the group, but the avalanche hit them so fast they were unable to get to safety.The rescuers, Abby Watkins and Rich Marshall, immediately skied down to the slide area and started to dig out those buried. The first person that they dug out called for help on his satellite phone, which mobilized a large rescue team. Then, as members of the group were freed from the slide, they helped dig out the others.Upon hearing the number of people who were caught in this avalanche, the rescuers wondered how so many could be involved. Their answer came when they flew to the scene of the avalanche: It was huge. The fracture zone was about 800 metres wide and the run?out was more than a kilometre long.The size of the rescue operation was also huge: more than 30 people, seven helicopters, six avalanche dogs and their handlers and dozens of support staff were involved. This was a multi-agency rescue, involving Parks Canada staff from three national parks, several local companies (Selkirk Tangiers Helicopter Skiing, Canadian Mountain Holidays, Selkirk Mountain Experience, Alpine Helicopters, Kokanee Helicopters, Shell Canada Revelstoke, Executive Flight Services), mountain guides, RCMP, tourists, medical staff and the Canadian Army stationed at Rogers Pass. Important services provided during the rescue included grief counseling, support to the families, media relations, transportation and logistical support.Participating in such a difficult situation is very stressful. It is tragic that seven young people lost their lives in the accident, and the people of Revelstoke and Golden have shared this grief. The speedy rescue helped save the lives of the remaining 10 people in the group, and to quickly recover the victims.The credit for the speed and efficiency of the entire rescue effort can be shared among all of those who participated in this rescue. Times such as these show how public safety professionals and volunteers truly rise to the occasion when called upon.The staff and management of Mount Revelstoke and Glacier National Parks would like to offer our gratitude and appreciation to all of the individuals who took part in the rescue efforts following the tragic avalanche of February 1, 2003.Steve Blagbrough Anders BlakstvedtEvelyn Enn  Kyle HaleScott Hicks Clair IsraelsonShelly Jackson Peter KimmelRich Marshall Carolyn McBainKathleen O'Toole Steve ParsonsGoran Skuncke Tuulikki TennantRemi Thieverge James VickersJohn Warren  Abby WatkinsThe staff of Alpine Helicopters Ltd. - Golden The staff of Brandon?Bowers Funeral Home - Revelstoke The staff of Canadian Avalanche Association - Revelstoke The staff of Canadian Mountain Holidays Inc. - Revelstoke and Gothics The staff of Executive Flight Services - Revelstoke The staff of Kicking Horse Mountain Resort - Golden The staff of Kokanee Helicopters - Revelstoke The staff of Selkirk Mountain Experience - Revelstoke The staff of Selkirk Tangiers Helicopter Skiing - Revelstoke The staff of Shell Oil - Revelstoke The staff of Yamnuska Inc. - Canmore Royal Canadian Mounted Police (Revelstoke, Cranbrook, Nelson, Kamloops and Vancouver) RCMP Revelstoke Victim Assistance Counselors British Columbia Ambulance Service (Golden and Revelstoke) British Columbia Coroner Chuck Purse 2nd Regiment, Royal Canadian Horse Artillery, Petawawa, ON.Please accept our (Parks Canadas) sincere thanks.Other SourcesNonewww.csac.org#*#HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"#*#Avalanche Incident (CSAC) - Canada, February 2, 2003Avalanche Incident, 2002-2003 SeasonDateLocationActivityKilledInjuredBulletinFeb 01CanadaSkiing710 (minor) [Photos] [Media Reports][Official Reports] [Other Sources]PhotosTopo Map segment showing location in relation to Hwy 1 and Rogers PassNewspaper photo of slide area and slide runoutMedia ReportsSeven skiers dead in second deadly B.C. avalanche in a monthREVELSTOKE, B.C. (CP) - Seven teens on a high-school ski excursion in the back country of east-central B.C. died Saturday when a half-kilometre-wide avalanche came down from above them and engulfed their group. It was the second deadly slide to hit the region in as many weeks. Seven adults perished in a slide in January. The dead were six boys and one girl, all in Grade 10 at Strathcona-Tweedsmuir School, a private day school on an expansive rural campus in the foothills southwest of Calgary."We are absolutely stricken with grief. Our hearts go out to all those who are impacted," Tony Macoun, head of the school, said in a written statement. Frantic parents gathered at the school Saturday night, arriving separately and in groups, embracing each other. No students were visible. "Our school is a small family and loss this extreme is impacting us tremendously," said Macoun. There were 17 people in the school group, three adults and 14 Grade 10 students in an outdoor education class, on their annual cross-country ski trip.The avalanche occurred on Mount Cheops in Glacier National Park just before noon, said Pam Doyle, superintendent for Parks Canada in Revelstoke.It happened on the north face of the mountain in Connaught Creek Valley section of Balu Valley, about five kilometres west of the Rogers Pass summit. The group was led by two male teachers and a male volunteer. All had certification and back-country experience, Macoun said. The group had been skiing about 15 metres apart, with one supervisor in front and the other two bringing up the rear. The skiers were halfway up the valley when the avalanche roared down the north slope, burying nearly the entire group.Another group of young skiers witnessed the avalanche and were among the first to help. A supervisor whose hand was just visible above the snow was the first to	be dug out. Once freed, he called park wardens on a satellite phone to raise the alarm. "Of the remaining students, six of the students are safe and one has a broken ankle," Macoun said in his statement.The three leaders were uninjured and are attending to the survivors, who were in Revelstoke on Saturday night after being airlifted first to Glacier Park Lodge by helicopter. Two people from the group were treated for minor injuries, said RCMP Sgt. Randy Brown.The avalanche was "very powerful," with a rating from 3 to 3.5, compared with a top rating of 4, said Pat Dunn, a Parks Canada spokeswoman. "The size 3 to 3.5 avalanche could destroy a building . . . or 10 acres of forest," she said. The slide was 500 to 800 metres wide and travelled a kilometre down the slope. Some of the skiers were buried as deep as three metres, said Dunn.She said the group was carrying the proper avalanche-rescue equipment, including personal locator beacons and digging tools.A park conditions bulletin said there was a considerable avalanche hazard	in the area Saturday. That rating is about the middle of the hazard scale but includes the high probability that a person could trigger a slide, said Dunn. "The risk always varies . . . when the risk is posted as considerable it's a note to skiers to be cautious," she said."There are a couple of instabilities in our snow pack this winter . . .that may have contributed and further investigation will determine (that)."Saturday's slide was unusually deadly, said Eric Dafoe, public safety officer with Parks Canada in Revelstoke. "We've never had an avalanche like this where we had a multiple number ofpeople buried," said Dafoe, who worked on the rescue effort and flew over the slide as part the initial investigation.  "It was a huge slide," he said. "It covered the valley floor from side to side." Dafoe said the slide began at a point between 2,200 to 2,300 vertical metres up Mount Cheops. It travelled for a kilometre and spread out half a kilometre at the sides. The toe of the slide ended at about the 1,500-metre elevation mark with parts of it more than five metres deep.Dafoe said the investigation will continue but was almost certain it was a natural slide. "It (the slide trigger site) is so far from the bottom it seems unlikely it was human-triggered," he said. Dafoe speculated a small slide may have occurred high up the mountain and as it came down, it dragged out snow from surrounding gullies.Park wardens, RCMP officers and local ski tour operators and guides, backed up by four or five helicopters and search dogs, joined in the rescue effort. Members of a Canadian Horse Artillery unit stationed in the park for avalanche-control work were also on hand to assist.Ruedi Beglinger, owner of Selkirk Mountain Experience and organizer of the fatal expedition last month, was with his clients when it struck. Contacted Saturday night, Beglinger did not want to comment on the level of experience necessary to ski the area where the students were caught. "There is an inherent risk (in back-country skiing) which is very important to talk about, an inherent risk people have to be willing to share amongst themselves (whether) they have a guide or not," he said.The area of Saturday's slide is not particularly remote, but Dunn said there were no groomed trails, "except people who have been there before you." But no guides are needed to ski in the area and skiers do not have to register before setting off. "It's a very, very popular ski destination site," said Dunn, media liaison officer at the national park.Brown said the skiers were not part of a commercial tour group.Doyle said that at this time there are no plans yet to close back-country areas of the park. Official ReportsAvalanche Tragedy in Glacier National Parkby: Doreen McGillis, Parks Canada(Published in the "Avalanche News" of the Canadian Avalanche Association)On February 1, 2003, a huge avalanche swept into the Connaught Creek drainage of Glacier National Park and into the awareness of millions of Canadians. This avalanche accident attracted the attention of the nation.

In the women's competition, Canadian Kim Csizmazia edged Australian Abby Watkins to win the title in the six-person field.Eighteen world-class climbers from around the globe converged on Uncompahgre Gorge in Colorado, USA, this weekend for the sixth annual Ouray Ice Festival. The festival is comprised of a climbing competition broken into two segments, including the Pure Ice and the Mixed Rock & Ice climbs.In the first competition, the Pure Skill and Artistry segment, the participants each choose a route up the falls purely on ice, with no rock climbing involved. Each competitor was judged on the difficulty of his or her chosen route and the efficiency, security, and artistry with which he or she climbed.In the second competition, the Gymnastics, Power and Vision Sport Mixed route, the athletes climbed on the designated mixed ice and rock route crafted by event organiser and climber Jeff Lowe. Points were awarded for each event and overall winners were declared.Canada's Rich Marshall finished in first place with a combined 219 points in the men's division. He credited his success to his creativity and selected route:"I was just looking for something a little different. I was number nine, so there wasn't a lot left that hadn't been done and to me it was just trying to find something that stimulated me as well.”Canadian Will Gadd took second place and finished 27 points behind Marshall. American Jared Ogden took third place - but it wasn't easy. Ogden struggled on the last chunk of ice near the top of the climb, but managed to collect 123 points in the combined events.The women's competition, which last year had only two climbers, featured six competitors this year. Canadian Kim Csizmazia claimed the first place prize with an extremely strong showing in the pure ice portion of the climb.Australian Abby Watkins finished second for the second consecutive year. Watkins used skilful body positioning to all but dominate the mixed competition.

EXPEDITION NEWS September 2004 HighlightsSeptember 2004 – Volume Eleven, Number Nine –EXPEDITION NEWS is the monthly reviewof significant expeditions, research projects and newsworthy adventures. Itis distributed online and by mail to media representatives, corporatesponsors, educators, research librarians, explorers, environmentalists, andoutdoor enthusiasts. This forum on exploration covers projects thatstimulate, motivate and educate.The following are highlights of our September issue, but this is only part ofthe story. Click here to subscribe to the full edition. or e-mail us for a free sample copy at  editor@ExpeditionNews.com Arctic Coring Expedition Seeks Record of Earth ClimateScientists believe a 50-million-year record of the Earth's climate lies in an underwater mountain chain in the ice-clogged waters near the North Pole.An international team is drilling deep into the Arctic Ocean ridge for the first time, in a technically complex effort to extract sediment that will provide a climatic history, and may help explain how humans are changing the planet."Think of it as a book," said Kate Moran, an associate professor in the ocean engineering department at the University of Rhode Island and a co-chair of the Arctic Coring Expedition. "We're turning back the pages of time."Scientists have wanted to make this trip for decades, but have never had the combination of icebreaking ships and advanced drilling equipment used by the oil industry to pull it off.ARCHAEOLOGISTS SEARCH FOR SLAVE SHIP IN CARIBBEAN Archaeologists are leading an expedition in hopes of finding a Spanish ship that wrecked along the jagged reefs off the Turks and Caicos Islands in 1841 carrying a cargo of African slaves.The story of the Trouvadore is unusual because all 193 slaves made it to shore, and all but one survived to see their freedom granted by a British government that had just outlawed slavery. Most settled in the arid, low-lying islands and began new lives working its salt ponds and raising families.The shipwreck holds particular significance for the British territory of 25,000 people because researchers believe virtually all native islanders have ties by blood or marriage to the survivors.EXPEDITION NOTESNorth Face Climbers Say: "Eye Care" – The North Face athletes Pete Athans, Abby Watkins, Kevin Thaw, and Jimmy Chin will travel to Nepal in November to climb as many unnamed peaks as they can to benefit the Himalayan Cataract Project (HCP) through The North Face partnership with Global Giving (every 1000 feet climbed, TNF will donate $100 dollars to the HCP). The Himalayan Cataract Project is dedicated to establishing a sustainable eye care infrastructure in the Himalaya that empowers local doctors to provide high-quality ophthalmic care through skills-transfer and education. The high Tibetan plateau has one of the highest rates of cataract blindness in the world. (For more information: www.CureBlindness.org).First All-Women Team Reaches Denali Via Cassin Ridge – Mountain Hardwear athletes Sue Nott and Karen McNeill, have once again pushed themselves beyond normal physical and psychological limits while pursuing their passion in the outdoors. On June 2, they became the first all-women team to reach the summit of Denali after climbing the Cassin Ridge, a 9,000 ft. route which is the only direct line to the summit.QUOTE OF THE MONTH"How can we protect nature if we dont understand it? When it comes to the ocean, we know practically nothing. In fact, we know more about the backside of the moon and the seas on Mars.  Unfortunately were still using the oceans as a garbage can, a universal sewer operating under the theory of out of sight, out of mind."  Explorer-environmentalist Jean-Michel Cousteau, who says hes recently found debris dumped 20-30 years ago on some of the most remote islands in the world. He spoke Aug. 2 on behalf of the Nantucket Conservation Foundation, on the island located off the Massachusetts coast. Hes the son of the late ocean explorer Jacques Cousteau.EXPEDITION FOCUS RGS Artifacts Move to New HomeThere's Charles Darwin's sextant, Edmund Hillary's oxygen canister and Dr. Livingstone's hat. They are among artifacts, available to the public for the first time, from the archives of the Royal Geographical Society, the 174-year-old British institution that sent explorers to the South Pole, up Mount Everest and in search of the source of the Nile  and amassed one of the world's largest geographical archives.The London-based society has opened an airy extension to its Victorian headquarters housing some two million records  maps, charts, books and photographs. Society director Rita Gardner said that the six-year, $13 million project had moved the documents from "Dickensian conditions" in the building's basement to climate-controlled rooms in the new wing.EXPEDITION MARKETING Arctic Team to Carry New Emergency Beacon – One reason companies sponsor expeditions with cash and gear donations is to demonstrate product performance in dire conditions. Next year the first summer crossing of the Arctic Ocean  a planned 1,240-mi. journey  by 43-year-old Lonnie Dupre of Minnesota, will serve as a proving ground for the new TerraFix 406 GPS Personal Locator Beacon (PLB) from ACR Electronics, Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. The TerraFix 406 is a satellite-detectable beacon that broadcasts critical GPS coordinates. It can increase emergency response speed by pinpointing positions within 100 m."Lonnie is a perfect example of a PLB user," said ACRs Paul Hardin, executive vice president. "He spends years preparing for an epic adventure to assure his success and survival. Though he never plans to use a PLB, it is an essential part of his contingency plan."Should he ever need Search and Rescue (SAR) assistance, the use of a PLB minimizes the cost of rescue and risk to SAR personnel as the technology takes the "search" out of Search and Rescue," Hardin says.

Jammed with memorabilia, the two capsules were intended to survive 5,000 years of rot and oxidation and then be opened by God-Knows-Who-or-What in the Year of Our Lord 6939.A bit more realistic time frame is planned for the Explorers Club time capsule which will be filled with artifacts and memorabilia that represent the past 100 years of exploration. For $150, those who contribute will have their name on a roll enclosed in the sealed capsule. The closing ceremony is planned for Dec. 17 during the Clubs Centennial Ball in New York.

"We're turning back the pages of time."Scientists have wanted to make this trip for decades, but have never had the combination of icebreaking ships and advanced drilling equipment used by the oil industry to pull it off.ARCHAEOLOGISTS SEARCH FOR SLAVE SHIP IN CARIBBEAN Archaeologists are leading an expedition in hopes of finding a Spanish ship that wrecked along the jagged reefs off the Turks and Caicos Islands in 1841 carrying a cargo of African slaves.The story of the Trouvadore is unusual because all 193 slaves made it to shore, and all but one survived to see their freedom granted by a British government that had just outlawed slavery. Most settled in the arid, low-lying islands and began new lives working its salt ponds and raising families.The shipwreck holds particular significance for the British territory of 25,000 people because researchers believe virtually all native islanders have ties by blood or marriage to the survivors.EXPEDITION NOTESNorth Face Climbers Say: "Eye Care" – The North Face athletes Pete Athans, Abby Watkins, Kevin Thaw, and Jimmy Chin will travel to Nepal in November to climb as many unnamed peaks as they can to benefit the Himalayan Cataract Project (HCP) through The North Face partnership with Global Giving (every 1000 feet climbed, TNF will donate $100 dollars to the HCP). The Himalayan Cataract Project is dedicated to establishing a sustainable eye care infrastructure in the Himalaya that empowers local doctors to provide high-quality ophthalmic care through skills-transfer and education. The high Tibetan plateau has one of the highest rates of cataract blindness in the world. (For more information: www.CureBlindness.org).First All-Women Team Reaches Denali Via Cassin Ridge – Mountain Hardwear athletes Sue Nott and Karen McNeill, have once again pushed themselves beyond normal physical and psychological limits while pursuing their passion in the outdoors. On June 2, they became the first all-women team to reach the summit of Denali after climbing the Cassin Ridge, a 9,000 ft. route which is the only direct line to the summit.QUOTE OF THE MONTH"How can we protect nature if we dont understand it? When it comes to the ocean, we know practically nothing. In fact, we know more about the backside of the moon and the seas on Mars.  Unfortunately were still using the oceans as a garbage can, a universal sewer operating under the theory of out of sight, out of mind."  Explorer-environmentalist Jean-Michel Cousteau, who says hes recently found debris dumped 20-30 years ago on some of the most remote islands in the world. He spoke Aug. 2 on behalf of the Nantucket Conservation Foundation, on the island located off the Massachusetts coast. Hes the son of the late ocean explorer Jacques Cousteau.EXPEDITION FOCUS RGS Artifacts Move to New HomeThere's Charles Darwin's sextant, Edmund Hillary's oxygen canister and Dr. Livingstone's hat. They are among artifacts, available to the public for the first time, from the archives of the Royal Geographical Society, the 174-year-old British institution that sent explorers to the South Pole, up Mount Everest and in search of the source of the Nile  and amassed one of the world's largest geographical archives.The London-based society has opened an airy extension to its Victorian headquarters housing some two million records  maps, charts, books and photographs. Society director Rita Gardner said that the six-year, $13 million project had moved the documents from "Dickensian conditions" in the building's basement to climate-controlled rooms in the new wing.EXPEDITION MARKETING Arctic Team to Carry New Emergency Beacon – One reason companies sponsor expeditions with cash and gear donations is to demonstrate product performance in dire conditions.

In the women's competition, Canadian Kim Csizmazia edged Australian Abby Watkins to win the title in the six-person field.Eighteen world-class climbers from around the globe converged on Uncompahgre Gorge in Colorado, USA, this weekend for the sixth annual Ouray Ice Festival. The festival is comprised of a climbing competition broken into two segments, including the Pure Ice and the Mixed Rock & Ice climbs.In the first competition, the Pure Skill and Artistry segment, the participants each choose a route up the falls purely on ice, with no rock climbing involved. Each competitor was judged on the difficulty of his or her chosen route and the efficiency, security, and artistry with which he or she climbed.In the second competition, the Gymnastics, Power and Vision Sport Mixed route, the athletes climbed on the designated mixed ice and rock route crafted by event organiser and climber Jeff Lowe. Points were awarded for each event and overall winners were declared.Canada's Rich Marshall finished in first place with a combined 219 points in the men's division. He credited his success to his creativity and selected route:"I was just looking for something a little different. I was number nine, so there wasn't a lot left that hadn't been done and to me it was just trying to find something that stimulated me as well.”Canadian Will Gadd took second place and finished 27 points behind Marshall. American Jared Ogden took third place - but it wasn't easy. Ogden struggled on the last chunk of ice near the top of the climb, but managed to collect 123 points in the combined events.The women's competition, which last year had only two climbers, featured six competitors this year. Canadian Kim Csizmazia claimed the first place prize with an extremely strong showing in the pure ice portion of the climb.Australian Abby Watkins finished second for the second consecutive year. Watkins used skilful body positioning to all but dominate the mixed competition.

 STEVE 'SHIPOOPY' SCHNEIDER   Speed Freak Interview with Steve 'Shipoopy' Schneider9 May '97Melbourne, Australia  The first time I saw Steve Schnider was in a climbing video. He was explaining the ins and outs of competition climbing on a tiny wall in what appeared to be someone's backyard. I remembered this espically because I wondered at the time, "Who is this guy and why the hell have they let him on this video?". His little skit was very funny but he seemed to be too much of a clown. I wondered why they hadn't picked a 'serious' climber for the role. This, I was to find out, was my first introduction to what seems to be Steve 'Shipoopy' Schnieder¹s motto, 'seriously, but never seriously'.It was later that I found out that Shipoopy (the name Steve Schneider sounds too serious for this guy) wasn't just the court jester, he was also a very 'serious' climber. The 'clown' I saw in the video was a certified UIAA course setter. At this stage he has climbed over 100 routes graded 5.13, climbed El Cap 43 times, he is at the cutting edge setting new records of speed and endurance. He's definately more than a clown.Australia holds a very special place for Shipoopy as he owes his initial break throughs to Australian influences. He climbed in Europe under the tutorlege of Kim Carrigan. Carrigan, who was one  of the top climbers at that stage, took him under his wing to train as a prodigere. This had a strong influence on Shipoopy as it was competing with Carrigan that he realised his potential. He laughs as he explains how Carrigan would get a little tweaked when his supremecy was challenged by this unknown American upstart.Sometime later Shpoopy spent three months climbing in Australia. Here again he was influenced by Australia. Under the influence of the locals he abandoned his purist ethics and starting hangdoging. The results amazed him and showed up pretty soon. He climbed his first three 5.13s at Arapps: Ogiver, Slinking Leopard and India. He has climbed over 100 5.13 since.Shpoopy has now made a name for himself speed climbing in the Yosemite Valley. Along with the likes of Hans Florine, Peter Croft and Dave Schultz, he has helped push speed and endurance records to amazing levels. At one point he set the speed record for the Nose (21hrs 22minutes). He has set endurance records by climbing three grade VI big wall climbs in one day pushes, all in one week; West Butteress (VI 5.10 A3+), Chinese Water Torture (VI 5.11 A4) and Dihedral Wall (VI 5.9 A3). All these climbs were done in fastest times to date. This feat remains unrepeated. With Hans Florine he climbed three El Cap routes in a day; Nose (VI 5.11 A3), Lurking Fear (VI 5.10 A3) and West Face (VI 5.11b). His climb Circus Circus reputed to be the most sustained climb in America when it was put up in 1992, still awaits a second ascent. This 500 foot route has successive pitches of 5.12c, 5.13a, 5.12c, 5.13c, 5.10a, 5.11a. It took 17 days to put up and he red pointed the route without taking any falls. He's  definately the unchallenged clown at his circus.I caught up with him on his second trip to Australia. He was on a lecture tour but he still found time to climb, tell bad blond jokes, give instructional clinics and ofcourse, laugh. Shipoopy is a man who is as serious about having fun as he is about having more fun. Have you done any climbing in Australia? Ten years ago I was here. I climbed in Australia for three months and in New Zealand for six weeks. I had a great time. I actually led my first 5.13 here in Australia. Which one was that?   Ogiver was my first and then I did India and Slinking Leopard.  That must have been a real break through for you. It was a breakthrough. I adopted the hangdog tactics of the locals. I used to be very pure and not like hanging on the rope. I started doing what the locals did and began to climb really hard. I really liked it. Do you plan to do any climbing this trip? Oh yeah. I climbed Ozymandieas Direct with Abby Watkins. We got some good information and we broke the record first try by 90 seconds! Briefly could you tell me a bit about the history of speed climbing in the Yosemite valley? It's a long proud history. The forefathers Robins, Roper those guys always took a watch along in the 50's and 60's and saw how fast they could go. I spoke to Roper, one of the pioneers in the 60's who wrote the first guide book, and he felt that there was a bit of a competitive thing going on from the out set. People would go up there with a watch and measure up their time. If someone broke a record, someone would get really pissed and shatter that one. They would get this record war  going on; they are still going on. Hans Florine, would get his Nose record broken  and would go back better it. Then Peter Croft would beat it. He figured the only way to keep it there would be to tie up with Peter Croft. They set the 4:22 record that's held on for 4 years now and good luck to anyone who wants to beat that. That's 4:22 over how many feet of climbing? Approximately 3000 feet. That's absolutely flying. If you wanted to divide 4:22 by 34 pitches you'll get their minutes per pitch. That's pretty impressive too. Is there any official way of measuring the time? The way speed climbers are measured: when the first person starts climbing, that's when the clock gets started and it is stopped when the last climber and/or the haul bag is pulled up over the edge. When the guy's jumars hit the anchors, that's when the clock stops. Has speed climbing developed because of the intensity of the scene in the Yosemite valley? I think it's just the competitive nature of man. The thrill of victory and the drama of athetlic competition. You see it in the Olympics and it just transfers over to climbing. Partly because there are some really great climbers that have gathered in Yosemite and have got really good at doing these things. Seeing that you have done so much speed climbing - what do you think of the early speed ascents that were done in the early 60's by people like Royal Robins. Especially without the modern gear like friends. I think its phenomenal. They were banging pitons. Steve Roper did the first grade VI in America, back in '66, the Regular Route on the Half Dome. He was gambling. They didn't have head lamps back in those days. Basically if they got caught out by night they would have to shiver it out till the morning. Steve says he remembers being there, before first light of the day, piton in his hand, just waiting for it to be light enough so he could see where to put it. He just charged it. He probably put 250 pitons in and out with his partner Jeff Foott that day. Surely no one have had used that many pitons like that. They just finished up in the light of the day. I just find it phenomenal that they just had this amazing craft of using pitons fast, not over driving them. That art of using pitons like that is lost because we use friends in anything over a one inch crack. In 1966 Steve Roper and Jeff Foott climbed the first grade VI in a one day ascent. Why do you think it took nearly a decade for that feat to be repeated? Well partly because the Half Dome is 2000ft and the Nose is 3000ft. So it was another big step up. No one actually thought he could do it. Could you describe the reaction of the climbing community when the North American Wall was climbed in a day in October 1990. It was the route which was considered to be the hardest in the world when it was first climbed in Œ64. There was alot of debate behind that. Guys like Peter Croft said that those guys climbed it in 24:05. Steve Gerbeding, Scott Stowe and Rick Lovelace were that honest. Peter Croft enraged those guys because he said, "you guys didn¹t do it. Now we are going to go up and do it in a day". To Gerbeding it didn¹t matter because they had done it single push. It didn¹t matter if it was 24:05 or 23:55. The thing is that they had gone up without the haulbag and done it. 	There were mixed reactions to that. There was a claim to the first true one day ascent of the North American Wall when it was done by Hans Florin and party when they did it in 21 hours something. The thing is that wouldn't have done it that fast or felt that they could do it that fast unless Steve had done it before them. 	Despite the mixed reaction, it was a big milestone. In '64 the North American Wall was considered the hardest technical rock route in the world. It was that route that brought a real notoriety to the Yosemite Valley. To have that route be climbed in a single push was absolutely mind blowing to the first ascentist and alot of other people, myself included. Are you familiar with that route? How many pitches is it? Around 28ish. Haven't climbed it yet. Saving it for that one day onsight. (Laughs) How does speed climbing differ from normal big wall climbing? The main thing is you don¹t have a haul bag and you have to be willing to climb at night. Not having the haul bag frees you from alot of extra work. It also gives you the commitment that you have to get up the wall otherwise you are going to have a really uncomfortable night out. You are committed to climb fast. You¹ve done your ground work. You¹ve done your grade IVs, your grade Vs in a day. You are ready to go fast. You've got less water. Because you are committed to going fast and going at night. You just do it.  Are there any major differences in technique? It's not so much technique. Alot of it is just beta. How to do these routes faster. When to combine pitches.	Basically its the same thing leaning, cleaning, hauling. You just keep your ropes really neat. Have a team of three working efficiently together as a team has been worked to a perfection in the last few years more than anything. In one week you climbed three Grade VIs in one day pushes, West Buttress, Chinese Water Torture and the Dihedral Wall. What were your thoughts at the end of that week?  What's the next step? Can I do four in a week? What¹s the next challenge? My body went through alot. It was a real test of my body. Every once in a while I want to test it to see what it can do and really push it. I was just amazed that I could go on like that. It's seeing what I can do, then learning from that and maybe adding on to it somehow. It's a progressive thing. Has anyone else done three Grade VIs in that short a stretch of time? Well I did three El Cap routes in a day. But they weren't onsight routes so that was a different thing. That particular trifecta hasn't been repeated. How many times have you climbed El Cap? 43 times as of this conversation. I hope to get to 50 by the end of the year. What's the attraction of climbing it that many times? Oh its fun. You can go up on a weekend and blast it in a speed climb. You come down and you are absolutely hammering. You go back to work Monday morning and you don't even care because your hands are just raw. You have this huge smile across your face when you do the Captain. Its absolutely addicting, totally phenomenal when you are up there and it's fun. Better than a carnival ride times ten. What was the initial reaction to John Bachar and Peter Croft's one day ascent of the Nose on El Cap and the Regular Route on the Half Dome? I think there wasn't too much surprise. I think people realised that it could be done. I had done two El Cap routes in a day. So it was just a natural progression that someone did. People who didn't know what had gone on before might have been surprised but really it was one of the next steps in things to do.  Could you tell me a bit about your climb Circus Circus? It was reputed to be the hardest sustained route in America (It has successive pitches of 5.12c, 5.13a, 5.12c, 5.13c, 5.10a, 5.11a.). Does it still hold that reputation? No, Salathe, the Nose, the Direct Route, all free, on the Half Dome are all harder.  It was up there in 1990. It was one of the hardest for sure. Top three long hard routes. There were very few routes that were that long that had multiple pitches of 5.13 on them. Atleast that I know about.	It was just a personally satisfying thing to do. I wasn't out there to put up the hardest single free climb. I was just drawn to this amazing line that I could see from the road. I just had to do it. Fate and destiny kind of control my life in these things. There are just some things that I had to do. I was so amazing that that climb was even possible when you look at it from the ground. It looks desperately thin and it looks like it isn't going to go and it does, barely. Still awaits a second ascent. Speed climbing is obviously extremely intense. Things like the Peter Croft and Dave Schultz duo climbing 42 pitches in a day sounds absolutely incredible. Those guys are a phenomenal team. But even they had limits. They tried to do a quadvecta. They did Higher Cathedral Rock by Mary¹s Tears, climbed the Rostrum, climbed the West Face of El Cap went to do Astroman and they were getting tired. Peter remembers getting to the top of the second pitch and Dave¹s hanging off a quarter inch bolt with a bomber friend crack right next to him. Peter couldn't for the life of him explain to him that he should have backed up the anchor. He was like, 'Huuuuh, whaaat'. They realised that they¹d better get down. They've been pushing it too hard. They couldn't tell the difference between a hallucination from a bolt. But its rad they tried it. 	Those two formed one of the best speed climbing teams ever. Their Rostrum time is like 1:45. They just free soloed this thing. They simol climbed this thing and they were fast. When I did it with Wally it took 5-6 hours. That's four or five times as long. The times involved are incredible enough and then they get bettered constantly. You soloed the nose in 21 hours something and then Hans Florine comes along and does it in 14 hours. I did the Nose in 21:22 and Hans climbed it in 14:57. He really shattered that record. To top that that was his first rope solo ever!  How does the climbing differ style at Toulomie Meadows differ from Yosemite? Yosemite valley is characteristic of very parallel cracks that lack alot of face holds. These force pretty hard difficult, finger wrenching, toe binding climbing maneuvers. Toulomie has all these protuberances or knobs and face edges. You can climb vertical faces much more naturally there than in the Yosemite valley. For me it developed a technique of being very technical on dead vertical faces with my feet. Being able to stay on really tiny edges really came to be an art form in Toulomie.	You see alot of climbers who climb at Toulomie, John Bachar, Kurt Smith and Ed Barry, in competitions their foot work does them wonders. In your article Sea of Domes you describe the tension the ethical wars has created there. The clash of ethics between ground up climbers like John Bachar and rap bolters such as Ron Kauk. Oh yeah. I don't think Ron's ever forgiven me for that article. Its never been the same between us but I just told it like it is. When you do something as public as chopping someone else's route I think you have to live up to it. If you aren't ready to do that maybe you shouldn't do it in the first place.	I chopped bolts once and it was a big mistake. I was sorry the next day. I was drunk when I did it. I learnt my lesson. I'll never chop bolts again. There was a big issue of ethics when Toulomie was started to get repelled placed bolts. I wanted to keep it a traditional area, to do routes from the bottom to the top. What was going to happen was that these routes were going to be done quicker than I could have done then in the traditional way. The rock would get used up because it is so limited. It came to a point where I had to make a choice weather to keep my friends or my ethics. I chose my friends. I chose to accept rap bolting rather than fight against it and make a bunch of enemies. So rap bolting is becoming very popular there? Yeah it's done all the time. I never do it though because I still love that adventure of not knowing if a routes going to go. I wouldn¹t ask anybody else to put routes from the ground up. I don't push any kind of ethics on any other people.	You want to set the bolts in the right place; sport climbing is an easier way of doing it. I manage to put the bolts in the right place by spending years doing it and being smart about it ground up style. But I think everybody has to just do what¹s right for them. I will respect them for that. Do you ever think the Toulomie testpiece Bachar/Yerian will ever be rap bolted?  It might be possible but they would get chopped. I would chop them if someone did that. That would be a blight to everyone who has gone up there and gotten the guts to do that route. That would be shitting on them. It would be bringing it down from another level.		You can fall from almost anywhere on the route and you won't die, you¹ll get hurt. So its not like you are looking at a death fall. You have to really build yourself into this spiritual mind awareness plane of really keeping your mind in control in the face of a big fall. It's been one of the best experiences. People have come from all over the world to do that route. So anyone who would put bolts into that, I can tell you would be slandered for life. At the end of your article you sign off as 'a wanna be alpinist'. Have you done any alpine climbing. I climbed Denali a few years ago. I went to Patagonia and looking to go to California and do some peaks there. I want to get into it. I would like to go to the Himalaya and do some really high peaks. Would you be interested in doing something like what Wolfgang Gullich did in the Trango Towers? Free climbing up that high? I would like to do those sort of things but I don¹t know who practical it is to really free climb there. To free climb in the mountains takes a long time. You are not going fast and speed is safety in alot of the mountains. Don't get me wrong, I would love to go up to the Trango Towers and free climb the Eternal Flame that Wolfgang and Kurt did in '88. Phenomenal route but in a way its not that practical; you¹ve gut to have decide whether, a certain section might take you two days to do....My whole speed climbing background has given me this attitude of just getting to the top getting down and then getting on something else. More summits, I want to do more. Quantity not quality. I want to do it all. Do you have any big projects planned in the near future? I've been injured for nine months since my honeymoon. It's a tendon thing; a honeymoon injury. I have no big projects planned except getting healthy. I plan to do some walls because that doesn't hammer my wrist as much as extreme free climbing. I dream of getting back to really hard climbing, back up to the level of 5.14 but I keep getting injured left and right. In the last three years I've broken three ribs (kayaking), broken my leg in two places (climbing) last year and three months later I injured my tendon (wind surfing). I¹m just having a hard time staying healthy right now.  MAIL ME HOME PAGE  #*# STEVE 'SHIPOOPY' SCHNEIDER   Speed Freak Interview with Steve 'Shipoopy' Schneider9 May '97Melbourne, Australia#*# #*# The first time I saw Steve Schnider was in a climbing video. He was explaining the ins and outs of competition climbing on a tiny wall in what appeared to be someone's backyard. I remembered this espically because I wondered at the time, "Who is this guy and why the hell have they let him on this video?". His little skit was very funny but he seemed to be too much of a clown. I wondered why they hadn't picked a 'serious' climber for the role. This, I was to find out, was my first introduction to what seems to be Steve 'Shipoopy' Schnieder¹s motto, 'seriously, but never seriously'.It was later that I found out that Shipoopy (the name Steve Schneider sounds too serious for this guy) wasn't just the court jester, he was also a very 'serious' climber. The 'clown' I saw in the video was a certified UIAA course setter. At this stage he has climbed over 100 routes graded 5.13, climbed El Cap 43 times, he is at the cutting edge setting new records of speed and endurance. He's definately more than a clown.Australia holds a very special place for Shipoopy as he owes his initial break throughs to Australian influences. He climbed in Europe under the tutorlege of Kim Carrigan. Carrigan, who was one  of the top climbers at that stage, took him under his wing to train as a prodigere. This had a strong influence on Shipoopy as it was competing with Carrigan that he realised his potential. He laughs as he explains how Carrigan would get a little tweaked when his supremecy was challenged by this unknown American upstart.Sometime later Shpoopy spent three months climbing in Australia. Here again he was influenced by Australia. Under the influence of the locals he abandoned his purist ethics and starting hangdoging. The results amazed him and showed up pretty soon. He climbed his first three 5.13s at Arapps: Ogiver, Slinking Leopard and India. He has climbed over 100 5.13 since.Shpoopy has now made a name for himself speed climbing in the Yosemite Valley. Along with the likes of Hans Florine, Peter Croft and Dave Schultz, he has helped push speed and endurance records to amazing levels. At one point he set the speed record for the Nose (21hrs 22minutes). He has set endurance records by climbing three grade VI big wall climbs in one day pushes, all in one week; West Butteress (VI 5.10 A3+), Chinese Water Torture (VI 5.11 A4) and Dihedral Wall (VI 5.9 A3). All these climbs were done in fastest times to date. This feat remains unrepeated. With Hans Florine he climbed three El Cap routes in a day; Nose (VI 5.11 A3), Lurking Fear (VI 5.10 A3) and West Face (VI 5.11b). His climb Circus Circus reputed to be the most sustained climb in America when it was put up in 1992, still awaits a second ascent. This 500 foot route has successive pitches of 5.12c, 5.13a, 5.12c, 5.13c, 5.10a, 5.11a. It took 17 days to put up and he red pointed the route without taking any falls. He's  definately the unchallenged clown at his circus.I caught up with him on his second trip to Australia. He was on a lecture tour but he still found time to climb, tell bad blond jokes, give instructional clinics and ofcourse, laugh. Shipoopy is a man who is as serious about having fun as he is about having more fun. Have you done any climbing in Australia? Ten years ago I was here.

Its never been the same between us but I just told it like it is. When you do something as public as chopping someone else's route I think you have to live up to it. If you aren't ready to do that maybe you shouldn't do it in the first place.	I chopped bolts once and it was a big mistake. I was sorry the next day. I was drunk when I did it. I learnt my lesson. I'll never chop bolts again. There was a big issue of ethics when Toulomie was started to get repelled placed bolts. I wanted to keep it a traditional area, to do routes from the bottom to the top. What was going to happen was that these routes were going to be done quicker than I could have done then in the traditional way. The rock would get used up because it is so limited. It came to a point where I had to make a choice weather to keep my friends or my ethics. I chose my friends. I chose to accept rap bolting rather than fight against it and make a bunch of enemies. So rap bolting is becoming very popular there? Yeah it's done all the time. I never do it though because I still love that adventure of not knowing if a routes going to go. I wouldn¹t ask anybody else to put routes from the ground up. I don't push any kind of ethics on any other people.	You want to set the bolts in the right place; sport climbing is an easier way of doing it. I manage to put the bolts in the right place by spending years doing it and being smart about it ground up style. But I think everybody has to just do what¹s right for them. I will respect them for that. Do you ever think the Toulomie testpiece Bachar/Yerian will ever be rap bolted?  It might be possible but they would get chopped. I would chop them if someone did that. That would be a blight to everyone who has gone up there and gotten the guts to do that route. That would be shitting on them. It would be bringing it down from another level.		You can fall from almost anywhere on the route and you won't die, you¹ll get hurt. So its not like you are looking at a death fall. You have to really build yourself into this spiritual mind awareness plane of really keeping your mind in control in the face of a big fall. It's been one of the best experiences. People have come from all over the world to do that route. So anyone who would put bolts into that, I can tell you would be slandered for life. At the end of your article you sign off as 'a wanna be alpinist'. Have you done any alpine climbing. I climbed Denali a few years ago. I went to Patagonia and looking to go to California and do some peaks there. I want to get into it. I would like to go to the Himalaya and do some really high peaks. Would you be interested in doing something like what Wolfgang Gullich did in the Trango Towers? Free climbing up that high? I would like to do those sort of things but I don¹t know who practical it is to really free climb there. To free climb in the mountains takes a long time. You are not going fast and speed is safety in alot of the mountains. Don't get me wrong, I would love to go up to the Trango Towers and free climb the Eternal Flame that Wolfgang and Kurt did in '88. Phenomenal route but in a way its not that practical; you¹ve gut to have decide whether, a certain section might take you two days to do....My whole speed climbing background has given me this attitude of just getting to the top getting down and then getting on something else. More summits, I want to do more. Quantity not quality. I want to do it all. Do you have any big projects planned in the near future? I've been injured for nine months since my honeymoon. It's a tendon thing; a honeymoon injury. I have no big projects planned except getting healthy. I plan to do some walls because that doesn't hammer my wrist as much as extreme free climbing. I dream of getting back to really hard climbing, back up to the level of 5.14 but I keep getting injured left and right. In the last three years I've broken three ribs (kayaking), broken my leg in two places (climbing) last year and three months later I injured my tendon (wind surfing). I¹m just having a hard time staying healthy right now. #*# #*#MAIL ME#*# #*#HOME PAGE#*# #*# #*#
NSR of Western Canada - The Ben Albert Memorial AwardHowa carefully planned adventure to the B.C. backcountry became a tragedythat swept seven teens to their deaths.     It's a soft, gray morning. The ground is blanketed byeight centimeters of fresh snow. The temperature hovers around zero.      The past 24 hours have been avalanche-free,and Abby Watkins and Rich Marshall are eager to get in a day of backcountryskiing amid the mountainous sweep near the summit of Rogers Pass ineastern British Columbia.      They are not alone. The mountain guidesspot a school group getting ready to press ahead into the popularBalu Pass. Husband and wife pause to say hello.     "It's a beautiful day out here, isn'tit?" says Abby. "Yes," someone responds.      They leave the 14 teenagers and threeadults behind, climbing briskly until they stop for a break in a treedarea.      Abby looks back at the people belowand a gangly teen, all arms and legs, catches her eye. "Aren'tkids funny? Look at that kid," she tells Rich.      At that very moment, just before noonon Saturday, something gives way on the rugged north face of CheopsMountain. Abby and Rich hear a thunderous roar. They watch in horroras a torrent of snow hurtles to the valley, picking up speed and debris.The school group is directly in its path.      Rich screams: "Avalanche! Avalanche!Avalanche!"      The skiers look up.     Ben Albert is frantically trying to cram his day packinto a big black backpack already bulging with clothes, equipmentand enough food for a breakfast and stir-fry dinner for himself andthree other hungry 15-year-olds. He finally wedges it in and staggersout the door. It's early Friday morning.      His mother, Carol Neale, watches uneasilyas he and her husband Gerald pull out onto the road and head to theCanadian Tire parking lot on the western edge of Calgary. There, Benwill rendezvous with 13 other Grade 10 students from the elite Strathcona-Tweedsmuirprivate school for a long weekend of backcountry, telemark skiing,a difficult activity that combines cross-country and downhill.      The trip is the culmination of twomonths of intense training and the most arduous yet of the school'scelebrated, year-long outdoor education program.      Despite the early hour, the excitementamong the 11 boys and three girls is infectious. Michael Shaw is sokeyed up he talked the night away with his younger sister Kathryn.She tried to get him to go to bed but he just kept talking.      They are close, these healthy, strong,accomplished 15-year-olds. Many have grown up together.      Michael and his best pal Taylor Carcasoleare there, in one of two vans that will take everyone to Rogers Pass.The two are inseparable. Teachers know them as "mischief."Taylor is the "mis," and Michael the "chief."      Ben Albert sees Scott Broshko and JeffTrickett. They are three parts of a group of four talented teens knownas the "Fearsome Foursome."      Scott has been talking about the expeditionalmost nonstop since training began. Outdoor trips are his passion.For his birthday, he asked for a sleeping bag.      The night before, Daniel Arato bombardedhis older brother Thomas with excited questions about what to take.      His father had left a day earlier forhis own ski trip. The two exchanged kisses and hugs. Mr. Arato toldhis son to keep his head in the game and do what he's told. As thetwo parted, Daniel told his dad: "I love you."      The leader of the expedition is teacherAndrew Nicholson, a skilled and experienced skier, well-trained inavalanche awareness. He is so demanding in checking snow conditionsthat previous groups have dubbed him "Nazi Nick."      Parents have signed waivers protectingthe school in the event of deaths or injuries, but Carol Neale isworried. She can't stop thinking about an avalanche less than twoweeks before that killed seven experienced backcountry skiers just40 kilometers away from where Ben and his classmates are headed.      Scott Broshko's mother, Donna, knowsabout that avalanche, too. But she thinks: "What is the likelihood?Just what is the likelihood of that?"      She gives him a quick hug. He'll beback on Monday.      It's a four-hour journey to Glacier National Park. Thewinding, 350-kilometre drive along the Trans-Canada Highway west fromCalgary offers some of the most stunning views in the country, repletewith neck-craning mountain walls and stomach-churning sheer dropsto valleys below.      Along the way are warning signs forfallen rocks and avalanche debris. Runaway lanes for truckers wholose their brakes on the steep inclines are common.      Even more ominous are five long avalanchetunnels protecting the highway from the walls of snow that regularlycut loose from the steep upper slopes surrounding Rogers Pass.      With an annual average snowfall ofup to 21 meters, the area has one of the deadliest concentrationsof avalanches in the world -- enough to keep an on-site military unitstationed there, equipped with explosives and howitzers to bring downthreatening avalanches before they become dangerous.      The vans arrive at the park about noon,and the STS expedition wastes no time heading for its weekend headquarters,the A.O. Wheeler Hut, an easy two-kilometer trek from the highway.The A-frame log building, complete with two wood stoves and propanesystems for cooking and light, is nestled in a cedar forest. The cabinsleeps 24 in three rooms.      The teenagers stow their large packsand, after exacting tests of snow conditions by Mr. Nicholson, theystart to ski, exhilarated by liberation from school on a Friday afternoonand giddy with the fresh mountain air.      That evening, exhausted from theirwonderful afternoon, the students are divided into groups. Each preparesits own dinner. Marissa Staddon and her group pig out on chocolatefondue. Scott Broshko's dines on quesadillas, much to the envy ofanother group grumpily making do with Hamburger Helper.      Through the night, snoring from Scottand his pal Jeff Trickett keeps some of the 11 boys in the same roomfrom sleeping.      By the time they wake Saturday morning,Parks Canada has already posted its avalanche bulletin for backcountryskiers. In tree-line and alpine areas, the avalanche risk has beenassessed as "considerable," the mid-range of the five possibleratings.      Below the tree line, the risk is assessedas "moderate," with natural avalanches unlikely. And theSTS group intends to stay below the tree line throughout its telemarkexpedition to Balu Pass.      But the bulletin also refers to weaksnow layers left over from early winter snowfalls that have failedto stabilize. There were similar references for the same mountainrange in avalanche bulletins last month, just before the deadly slidethat claimed seven lives near Revelstoke, B.C.      The group makes its way to the RogersPass information building, a macaroni-shaped structure with a sodand timber roof, to pore over the latest information. Mr. Nicholsongoes inside. He asks about conditions in several areas before headingback to the students and two other adults -- a fellow teacher anda chaperone.     The group decides it is safe to ski that day. By 10:15 a.m., theyare on the trailhead to the pass, five kilometers away, describedby backcountry enthusiasts as an easy, but beautiful trail. They skithrough forest, along a rocky creek, over a snow-covered bridge andinto the Connaught Creek valley. Surrounded by mountains and deeppowder snow, the scenery is breathtaking.      Reminders of past avalanches are everywhere.Relentless slides tearing down either side of the valley over theyears have littered the area with rocks and stumps. Foliage is sparseon the valley floor.      The school group successfully crossesfour avalanche-prone paths on the north side of the valley, and threeon the south side. They note that the debris from one avalanche pathacross the valley is no more than a week old.      They are halfway to their destination.      The guide's frantic warning comes too late. The avalanchehits them head on.      In a matter of seconds, all 17 skiersare swept away in a huge, terrifying tangle of snow, rocks and trees.      The swiftness and power of the avalanchesounds like a freight train moving at high speeds, Abby thinks. "Ahuge roar. The power of that much snow moving at the accelerationof gravity and propagating more and more snow on the way. . . . Nobodycould have got out of the way. Nobody."Avalanche Spread     The river-rush of snow engulfs the skiers, then separates them. Asection of the slide breaks away and keeps going, carrying a numberof victims hundreds of meters down the valley. Disoriented and tumblinghead over foot with little chance to "swim" to the surface,this unlucky group ends up as much as 4.5 meters beneath the concrete-hardsnow.      Up in the trees, Abby and Rich aredusted by a thick cloud of powder. A terrible silence falls over thevalley. Though their hearts are thumping, they shut down their emotions.On goes the search-and-rescue switch, one they have trained for yearsto put into practice.      They race down to the first group ofburied skiers. The only sign of life is an odd hand and a few legspoking through the snow. The others, in the toe of the slide at thebottom of the valley, are buried much deeper.      Alone at the scene, the husband-and-wifeteam is faced with heartbreaking decisions. Who to save first?      Not everybody would make it, they reason.But those trapped near the top would have a better shot at survival.      Rich runs for the first hand he seesand begins digging. It's Andrew Nicholson. He finds Mr. Nicholson'sshovel so the group leader can dig himself out, and moves on. Mr.Nicholson has a satellite phone and calls for help.      But for the next 45 minutes, exceptfor the victims, Rich and Abby are there by themselves, working tofree as many as they can from their tombs of suffocating snow. Theguides' transceivers work perfectly, honing in with beeps and flashinglights on the buried skiers equipped with their own avalanche beacons,like shouts from the grave.      The couple follows the rules of avalancherescue like clockwork. Only dig to a victim to make sure he or sheis breathing. Clear snow from the victim's face. No CPR before movingon to the next victim. There are too many. Let survivors dig themselvesout.      Once free, the numb and distraughtliving do their best to help. Taylor Carcasole is frantic. His bestfriend Michael Shaw is missing. "Where's Michael? Where's Michael?"      The victims are scattered beneath thesnow. Rich and Abby split up to cover as much ground as possible.The first five people they pull out survive. Those survivors go onto rescue others. Everyone else Abby and Rich uncover is dead.      The grim lottery of who shall liveand who shall die is over. Seven students make it. Seven do not.      An hour after the avalanche, sevenhelicopters, three dogs and more than 30 individuals are on site.By 1:30 p.m., the final victim has been dug out. One survivor, witha broken ankle, is tobogganed out and airlifted to hospital. The remainingsurvivors are transported by helicopter to the cafeteria of the parkwarden's station. The bodies go, too. They are laid out on mats ina makeshift morgue in the same building.      Chuck Purse, Revelstoke's part-timecoroner, is investigating his second seven-death avalanche withintwo weeks. He examines each body in turn. None show signs of majorinjury. They were simply swept away and buried, dying from asphyxiation.      The bodies are wrapped in blankets,put in body bags and taken to the local Brandon Bowers Funeral Chapel.Co-owner Gary Sulz sends ordinary vans to collect the bodies becausehe thinks the sight of a fleet of hearses will upset the survivors.      Back in Calgary, news of the tragedybegins rippling through the close-knit community of parents by lateafternoon.      Donna and Dave Broshko are just leavingfor evening mass when Strathcona-Tweedsmuir head Tony Macoun callsto tell them there's been an accident. He says there are fatalities.He doesn't say who has died.      Mrs. Broshko immediately phones BenAlbert's mother, Carol Neale. Ben and Scott have been classmates sinceelementary school. "Carol, have you heard? There's been an accident."     "What are you talking about? No!"she screams. "I told him I didn't want him to go . . . I didn'twant him to go."      At the Arato home, Peter, skiing thatweekend at Big White in Kelowna, B.C., is talking to his wife whenher cell-phone rings. A friend has heard news reports of a tragedywhere their son Daniel was skiing. Mr. Arato soon learns from theradio that seven are dead from a school near Okotoks, where his boy'sschool is. He thinks the odds will not be in his favour.      The parents are told to go to the school.Judith Arato makes the 30-kilometre drive alone. She calls Peter inhysterics. Daniel is dead. Mr. Arato's friends charter a plane andsend him home.      Carol Neale's worst fears are confirmedthe moment she arrives at Strathcona-Tweedsmuir. As she steps insidethe foyer, another mother stops her. "I've heard from my son,"she tells Ms. Neale, relief written all over her face.     "I haven't heard from my son,"replies Ms. Neale. Minutes later, Tony Macoun tells her why. Ben isdead.     Mrs. Broshko, meanwhile, is panic-stricken, a horrible sinking feelingin the pit of her stomach. She can't stand not knowing. She phonesthe RCMP in Revelstoke. No luck. She phones Glacier Park Lodge, begginga clerk to go across the highway where the survivors are to see ifher Scotty is alive.     "Oh, please, please, please, go acrossthe road for me. I will be forever in your debt. Tell me that my sonis there."      The woman agrees. She phones back.No one will tell her anything.      Finally, the anguished couple headfor the school. They are ushered in to see Mr. Macoun. "It'ssuch a tragedy," he begins.     "I don't want to hear about the tragedy.Just tell me about Scott," Mrs. Broshko says.      Mr. Macoun says: "I'm very sorry.Scott's gone."      That night, Donna Broshko sleeps with apicture of Scott and her taken just before he went to the school'sformal Christmas dance. He is wearing his dad's suit and tie. Hisfather wore the same suit and tie at Scott's funeral on Thursday.     Skiers are soon back on the same Connaught Creek trail where lastweek's avalanche claimed its bright young victims. They ask offhandedlyabout "the morgue," worried that the jagged debris may betricky to cross.      Not far from the trailhead lies a wreath,with two ski poles stuck upright in the snow. Names of the dead 15-year-olds-- Jeff Trickett, Scott Broshko, Daniel Arato, Ben Albert, MarissaStaddon, Michael Shaw and Alex Pattillo -- are listed on the wreath,with the epigraph "Your Youth Will Be Eternal."      Farther along the path one glimpsesa more somber memorial: the deadly toe of the avalanche. At the bottomof the valley are three pits. They are several meters deep, a meteracross, and not far apart. Three burial holes left behind, and noone has filled them in.Timetableof tragedy OnSaturday, Feb. 1, 14 Grade 10 students from Strathcona-TweedsmuirSchool south of Calgary, set out on a backcountry ski trip up theBalu Pass in Glacier National Park, B.C. At around 11:45 a.m., theywere caught in an avalanche that killed seven of them. Here is thesequence of events on that day.1. Before departing, the leaders checked with theNational Park staff for current avalanche conditions. They were advisedthat the threat of avalanches was moderate below the tree line andconsiderable above it. Students were equipped with personal avalanchebeacons, probes and shovels. At 8:40 a.m., students left A.O. WheelerHut by van and headed to Rogers Pass Information Center, where theyconducted at least one test for avalanche risk.2. 10:15 a.m.: Commencement of trip up the Balu Passtrail. Following standard procedure, the one teacher led and the otheradult leaders followed at the rear of the skiers, who were 15 metresfrom each other.3. 11:45 a.m.: About halfway up the valley, an avalancheslid off the ridge of Cheops Mountain burying the group. Two skiersabout 200 meters ahead helped rescue the teacher in the lead who contactedwardens by satellite phone. 12:30 p.m.: Six students were reported alive.12:45 p.m.: Wardens arrive.4. 1:30 p.m.: All students were accounted for, includingthe seven who lost their lives.1.45 p.m.: One of the students was tobogganed backto the motel with a broken ankle. Meanwhile, helicopters joined therescue and airlifted students to the motel parking lot, from wherethey were transported to a private home in Revelstoke.Howthe avalanche happened    A small slide began high up on the ridge of Cheops Mountain, abovethe south side of Connaught Creek Valley. This set off a huge secondslide that crashed into the valley bottom with such force that itrode high up the opposite wall as it was redirected eastward downthe valley, burying the group of skiers.Copyright1995 - 2003.

They were simply swept away and buried, dying from asphyxiation.      The bodies are wrapped in blankets,put in body bags and taken to the local Brandon Bowers Funeral Chapel.Co-owner Gary Sulz sends ordinary vans to collect the bodies becausehe thinks the sight of a fleet of hearses will upset the survivors.      Back in Calgary, news of the tragedybegins rippling through the close-knit community of parents by lateafternoon.      Donna and Dave Broshko are just leavingfor evening mass when Strathcona-Tweedsmuir head Tony Macoun callsto tell them there's been an accident. He says there are fatalities.He doesn't say who has died.      Mrs. Broshko immediately phones BenAlbert's mother, Carol Neale. Ben and Scott have been classmates sinceelementary school. "Carol, have you heard? There's been an accident."     "What are you talking about? No!"she screams. "I told him I didn't want him to go . . . I didn'twant him to go."      At the Arato home, Peter, skiing thatweekend at Big White in Kelowna, B.C., is talking to his wife whenher cell-phone rings. A friend has heard news reports of a tragedywhere their son Daniel was skiing. Mr. Arato soon learns from theradio that seven are dead from a school near Okotoks, where his boy'sschool is. He thinks the odds will not be in his favour.      The parents are told to go to the school.Judith Arato makes the 30-kilometre drive alone. She calls Peter inhysterics. Daniel is dead. Mr. Arato's friends charter a plane andsend him home.      Carol Neale's worst fears are confirmedthe moment she arrives at Strathcona-Tweedsmuir. As she steps insidethe foyer, another mother stops her. "I've heard from my son,"she tells Ms. Neale, relief written all over her face.     "I haven't heard from my son,"replies Ms. Neale. Minutes later, Tony Macoun tells her why. Ben isdead.     Mrs. Broshko, meanwhile, is panic-stricken, a horrible sinking feelingin the pit of her stomach. She can't stand not knowing. She phonesthe RCMP in Revelstoke. No luck. She phones Glacier Park Lodge, begginga clerk to go across the highway where the survivors are to see ifher Scotty is alive.     "Oh, please, please, please, go acrossthe road for me. I will be forever in your debt. Tell me that my sonis there."      The woman agrees. She phones back.No one will tell her anything.      Finally, the anguished couple headfor the school. They are ushered in to see Mr. Macoun. "It'ssuch a tragedy," he begins.     "I don't want to hear about the tragedy.Just tell me about Scott," Mrs. Broshko says.      Mr. Macoun says: "I'm very sorry.Scott's gone."      That night, Donna Broshko sleeps with apicture of Scott and her taken just before he went to the school'sformal Christmas dance. He is wearing his dad's suit and tie. Hisfather wore the same suit and tie at Scott's funeral on Thursday.     Skiers are soon back on the same Connaught Creek trail where lastweek's avalanche claimed its bright young victims. They ask offhandedlyabout "the morgue," worried that the jagged debris may betricky to cross.      Not far from the trailhead lies a wreath,with two ski poles stuck upright in the snow. Names of the dead 15-year-olds-- Jeff Trickett, Scott Broshko, Daniel Arato, Ben Albert, MarissaStaddon, Michael Shaw and Alex Pattillo -- are listed on the wreath,with the epigraph "Your Youth Will Be Eternal."      Farther along the path one glimpsesa more somber memorial: the deadly toe of the avalanche. At the bottomof the valley are three pits. They are several meters deep, a meteracross, and not far apart. Three burial holes left behind, and noone has filled them in.Timetableof tragedy OnSaturday, Feb. 1, 14 Grade 10 students from Strathcona-TweedsmuirSchool south of Calgary, set out on a backcountry ski trip up theBalu Pass in Glacier National Park, B.C. At around 11:45 a.m., theywere caught in an avalanche that killed seven of them. Here is thesequence of events on that day.1. Before departing, the leaders checked with theNational Park staff for current avalanche conditions. They were advisedthat the threat of avalanches was moderate below the tree line andconsiderable above it. Students were equipped with personal avalanchebeacons, probes and shovels. At 8:40 a.m., students left A.O. WheelerHut by van and headed to Rogers Pass Information Center, where theyconducted at least one test for avalanche risk.2. 10:15 a.m.: Commencement of trip up the Balu Passtrail. Following standard procedure, the one teacher led and the otheradult leaders followed at the rear of the skiers, who were 15 metresfrom each other.3. 11:45 a.m.: About halfway up the valley, an avalancheslid off the ridge of Cheops Mountain burying the group. Two skiersabout 200 meters ahead helped rescue the teacher in the lead who contactedwardens by satellite phone. 12:30 p.m.: Six students were reported alive.12:45 p.m.: Wardens arrive.4. 1:30 p.m.: All students were accounted for, includingthe seven who lost their lives.1.45 p.m.: One of the students was tobogganed backto the motel with a broken ankle. Meanwhile, helicopters joined therescue and airlifted students to the motel parking lot, from wherethey were transported to a private home in Revelstoke.Howthe avalanche happened    A small slide began high up on the ridge of Cheops Mountain, abovethe south side of Connaught Creek Valley. This set off a huge secondslide that crashed into the valley bottom with such force that itrode high up the opposite wall as it was redirected eastward downthe valley, burying the group of skiers.Copyright1995 - 2003.

She gracefully contemplated                             every move with slow, lizard-like precision and pulled her slender                             85 pound frame to the top of the X Games podium for the third                             time.

The two sportclimbing disciplines  difficulty and speed  will not produce similar winners. The difficulty discipline requires agility and endurance in order to bring your body and rope to each consecutive carabiner. Climbers must have the ability to rest on just fingers or toes while deciphering the best body position and technique for each step.  Speedclimbing is about eye-hand synchronicity and flow, with your competitor at your side (though hopefully below you).

Oh yeah, and she's only 17 and now is "allowed" to take on the world. Last year, France's Liv Sansov and Belgian Muriel Sarkany took second and third, respectively, so stand back because they are sure to be looking for redemption.In the men's division, there's an unfortunate absence of American Chris Sharma, who, with the passage of his 17th birthday, is now also allowed entrance to the "adult" world of sportclimbing. This rite of passage earlier gained him access to the World Cup circuit, and with that ticket he became the first American man to bring a World Cup win back to the U.S.. Sharma injured his knee when he fell while bouldering in Colorado last month.The American veteran is Hans Florine. At the ripe old age of 34, Hans is the still the speed master, a quality perhaps underestimated last year by fellow American Chris Bloch. The "old" man attacked the wall with such intensity he had the crowd roaring and not only didn't tire, but seemed to pull himself upward faster and faster. Bloch was again relegated to second while Hans captured his third X Games gold. So this good natured rivalry is also sure to be Xciting.Elena Ovchinnikova, 33, took both the '95 and '97 X Games speedclimbing titles and only missed '96 to give birth to her second child.  This transplanted (to Las Vegas) Siberian will be looking to earn yet a third gold. Australian Abby Watkins settled with silver last year and Mi Sun-Go, of Korea, in a close battle took the bronze. The head-to-head attack format of speedclimbing means even the slightest mistake can lead to not gaps but bridges in the finishes.

Westwide Accident Report DatabaseAccident ReportDate:02-01-2003	  Submitted By:WWAN *UPDATED MEDIA 03-01-03*	  Place:Mount Cheops; Rogers Pass area of Glacier National Park 	  State:BC	  Country:CANADA          Fatalities:7	  Activity:SKI          Summary:17 Skiers caught, 15 buried, 7 killed	  ***MEDIA REPORTS***AN OFFICIAL REPORT FROM CAA WILL BE POSTED WHEN AVAILABLEPLEASE VISIT:http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/siadventure/24/avalanche/A Deadly Avalanche In an instant a wilderness ski trip became a nightmare as British Columbia's second fatal avalanche in 12 days claimed seven young livesBy George Dohrmann The monstrous slide, estimated at more than 850 yards wide, hit with enough force to flatten 10 acres of forest.  Kip Wiley They were marching up the valley in pairs, their eyes alternating between the two feet of fresh powder under their skis and their destination: the top of the Balu Pass Trail, a ribbon of snow 550 yards wide in British Columbia's Glacier National Park. The valley is named after the creek that parts it, the Connaught, but residents call the primary ski route through this remote part of western Canada simply Balu. One of North America's most popular backcountry recreation areas, the Connaught Valley is moderately difficult to ski and was well known to the 14 high school students moving up its north side on Feb. 1. They were children of privilege, 10th-graders at the prestigious Strathcona-Tweedsmuir School (STS) outside Calgary, Alberta. A four-day trip to the Rogers Pass area of Glacier National Park, which includes Balu, had been a tradition at STS for more than 20 years. And for this year's group -- 14 students, two teacher-guides and another adult -- Day Two held great promise. The temperature was approaching 30¡ when they left the Rogers Pass information center shortly after 9:30 a.m., and although clouds hid the ridge tops, windows of blue sky gave the air a welcoming crispness. Watching the group ski up the valley were Rich Marshall and his wife, Abby Watkins, professional guides from Golden, B.C. They had stopped for tea in some timber at 5,500 feet, and as they stood sipping from thermoses, they could see the students about 300 feet below, a twisting line of earth tones in their Gore-Tex jackets and snug hats slowly ascending the same broken trail that Marshall and Watkins had skied. At 11:45, as Marshall was closing his thermos, he heard a sharp crack from across the valley, from the menacing north-facing slope of Mount Cheops, a peak considered too steep to ski. Marshall saw the snowpack at approximately 7,900 feet give way and begin a screaming descent toward the students and their guides. "Avalanche! Avalanche! Avalanche!" he yelled. The students had only seconds before the monstrous slide, estimated at more than 850 yards wide and moving with enough force to flatten 10 acres of forest, hit. First came a "wall of snow," one student later told wardens, and then "blackness." Marshall and Watkins were dusted by the avalanche and waited for it to settle before speeding toward the group. Investigators would later conclude that the couple saved at least five lives. But there would be little solace in that fact. While seven youngsters and three adults survived the avalanche, another seven motivated and promising teenagers -- six boys and one girl -- died. As funerals were held last week, much of what Calgary learned about the lost students came from thumbnail sketches in the newspapers. Ben Albert was a hockey and volleyball player; Daniel Arato, an eccentric who rode a unicycle; Scott Broshko, a trumpet player and four-sport athlete; Alex Patillo, a lover of the theater; Michael Shaw, a computer whiz who favored sailing; Jeff Trickett, a witty saxophone player; and Marissa Staddon, a figure skater who loved climbing with her father. The loss of young life leveled the community and sparked a debate over the value of outdoor programs at schools like Strathcona-Tweedsmuir -- a debate that was played out, wrenchingly, even at the victims' funerals. "What kind of character are we trying to build by this type of adventure -- Rambos?" said Arato's grandfather, John Konig, during the service for his grandson. The next day 17-year-old Amanda Shaw, Michael's older sister, stepped to the podium at Christ Church and gave STS a much-needed vote of confidence. "Nobody could have predicted it; nobody could have prevented it," said Amanda, who went on an earlier Rogers Pass trip. "It's a great character-building program." Parks Canada has come under fire as well. On Jan. 20 an avalanche on the Durrand Glacier, 20 miles from Rogers Pass, had buried 13 skiers and snowboarders, killing seven. Among the dead were four Americans -- Kathleen Kessler of Truckee, Calif.; Dennis Yates of Los Angeles; Ralph Lunsford of Littleton, Colo.; and world-champion snowboarder Craig Kelly of Mount Vernon, Wash. The death toll for these two avalanches is equal to the average number of avalanche deaths in Canada for the past five winters. Says Peter Arato, Daniel's father, "When a tragedy is called an accident, it implies it was unavoidable. But what happens in life is never that black and white." There is no gray when it comes to how Canadians feel about their right to explore their national parks. While there is no way to track the number of Canadians who venture into the wild, "it is clear that number is growing rapidly," said Ross Cloutier, a mountain guide who chairs the adventure programs department at University College of the Cariboo in Kamloops, B.C. "It is what this generation wants to do." The most recent avalanche has spurred Parks Canada to review how it keeps adventurers safe, but parks officials and outdoor enthusiasts scoff at taking more-radical steps such as closing areas deemed hazardous. "You can't regulate the backcountry," says Cloutier. "You can't lock it up." The controversy swirling around the school programs won't pass easily. Whether the 14 STS students should have been on the mountain has been debated not only during eulogies but also in classrooms and at dinner tables, in the Irish pubs on Calgary's bustling 8th Avenue and in mountain towns such as Revelstoke, B.C., home to the coroner who has investigated all 14 deaths in this year's two avalanches. Outdoor excursions at STS and at other schools across Canada have been canceled or postponed as officials and families ponder whether learning the lessons that nature teaches is worth putting children in harm's way. "How this debate goes will determine if mountain adventure programs are viable," said Dan Murphy, principal at Banff (Alberta) Mountain Academy, which canceled some trips after Feb. 1. "We can only hope," says Alf Skrastins, director of outdoor programs at the University of Calgary, "that the people doing the criticizing understand the role nature can play in children's lives." That role is defined early at Strathcona-Tweedsmuir. Initiation for first-grade students includes a weekend during which they sleep in tents on campus, which covers 170 acres in the eastern foothills of the Rockies. They learn environmental tenets such as "leave it as you found it" and are introduced to places on campus where they can hike, ski, canoe, rock climb or otherwise explore. High school and junior high students participate in trips of several days, such as the excursion to Rogers Pass, which was part of a for-credit course for 10th-graders. "The outdoor education program has made such a difference," says Christine Kolanos, a former member of the school's volunteer board who sent all four of her children to STS. "It teaches students the drive, desire and dedication needed to succeed in life." All those attributes were possessed by the 14 students who left Calgary on the last day of January. The teenagers also appear to have been well versed on the potential dangers in Glacier National Park. On Friday, as the group's vans rode the four hours to Rogers Pass, they passed avalanche warning signs and went through five long tunnels built because constant slides had buried the highway. Once in Rogers Pass, the students skied for 20 minutes from the highway to A.O. Wheeler Hut, a three-bedroom log cabin maintained by the Alpine Club of Canada. That afternoon they skied near the cabin, and -- supervised by Andrew Nicholson and Dale Roth, avalanche-certified teachers -- they dug avalanche pits, did snowpack testing and performed compression tests on every slope. They set out storm boards to collect the overnight snowfall and in the morning compared the samples with the snow already on the ground. They then skied to the visitors' center, where Nicholson talked with officials about snow conditions and was given a daily bulletin that included weather conditions, satellite imagery and avalanche danger ratings. The report for Feb. 1 stated that below the tree line, where the group planned to stay, avalanche danger was "Moderate -- Natural avalanches are unlikely. Human triggers are possible." However, their route offered no protection if an avalanche occurred in the alpine areas above them, which included the 8,550-foot peak of Mount Cheops. In the alpine areas the threat was deemed "Considerable -- Natural avalanches are possible. Human triggers are probable." The guides conferred with the students, who, according to school officials, wanted to ski for Balu. Nicholson and Roth made the final decision to proceed. They were headed up a valley in Glacier National Park, one of the most unstable areas in Western Canada. The Canadian army routinely fires howitzers in Rogers Pass in an attempt to trigger controlled avalanches and keep the highway and railways clear. Layers of snow packed in the last few months had done little to lessen the threat of avalanches. A Jan. 20 layer "easily released" during tests, according to the daily report given to Nicholson. A Dec. 6 layer suffered "compression test failures." Worst of all was the deep November layer. Two laminated crusts of ice sandwiched a layer of unstable crystals to form a sort of snow plywood that had worried avalanche watchers all winter. "Every year the snowpack is questionable up there," says John Seibert, an experienced backcountry ski-mountaineer from Alaska who survived the Jan. 20 avalanche on the Durrand Glacier, "but that's the risk. And to learn about yourself, you have to take risks." Before the trip students had completed fitness tests and lessons in avalanche awareness and rescue. During the ascent, they followed the standard practice for traveling in avalanche zones of maintaining spacing between skiers, in this case keeping 30 to 50 feet between pairs. And about15 minutes into the trip the guides stopped the column and quizzed each student on avalanche safety protocol. "They were as prepared as they could have been," says Ingrid Healy, assistant head of school at STS. "As anyone could have been." The wind was blowing less than 16 mph at the tree line, but it was stronger at the top of Mount Cheops, where it had been blowing between 20 mph and 45 mph all week. At 11:45 a.m. something, perhaps the weight of snow blown over the shoulder of the mountain, became too much for the January layer, and it cracked and slid down the mountain. By itself it would have merely dusted the valley beneath it -- something the STS group could tell friends about upon their return. But the weight was too much for the Dec. 6 layer to hold, and the two layers' combined heft easily cracked the fragile November crust, sending approximately 1,000 tons of snow into the valley. "We see an avalanche of that magnitude [3.5 out of 5] at least once a year, but usually not in that pass," says Eric Dafoe, a public safety coordinator for Parks Canada, "and usually during a big storm period, when no one is around." The snow hit Nicholson first, pushing him toward where Marshall and Watkins stood. Marshall located Nicholson quickly because one of his arms was exposed. After freeing him enough to allow him to begin digging himself out, Marshall skied down to help Watkins. "When we arrived down at the debris, we saw just about everybody was buried," Watkins told Global TV affiliate CHAN in Vancouver. "We just started moving toward signs of life -- a ski glove -- and digging, finding a face, making sure they're breathing and then moving on." Each student carried a shovel and a probe and wore an avalanche beacon, which emits a beeping signal that can be received by another beacon. The closer Watkins got to a buried student, the louder and more frequent the beeps. She and Marshall moved quickly, but some of the group had tumbled more than 200 yards down the valley. Once free, some of the rescued began trying to dig out their friends. Nicholson, who was carrying a satellite phone, called the Rogers Pass warden, and within 40 minutes 10 rescuers were on the scene. The number grew quickly to 40 -- including park staff, mountain guides, military personnel and heli-ski guides. Among the last group were staff members from the Selkirk Mountain Experience, whose owner, Ruedi Beglinger, led the tragic Jan. 20 expedition on the Durrand Glacier. But seven of the students had been buried too deep. It would be an hour and 20 minutes from the time the avalanche hit before the last body was lifted from its grasp. "They were just in the wrong place at the wrong time," says Dafoe. In the days following the disaster, grieving parents questioned the decision to go for Balu. If the chances of an avalanche were "considerable" just above where the students were to ski, why take the risk? STS head Tony Macoun insists that the risks were weighed by all. "This was not a case of the leaders dictating what would happen," he says. But are teenagers mature enough and informed enough to weigh the risks inherent in such a decision? The criticism from Arato's family made the front pages of newspapers across Canada, as did Amanda Shaw's defense of the STS program and of Nicholson. ("He didn't want to take a risk for anything," she said.) In the following days other family members showed support for the school's program and the decision to go for Balu. "I am at peace with the decision to proceed with the trip that day," said Karl Staddon, Marissa's father. At the same time, at least one of the victims' families has reportedly talked to an attorney about filing a lawsuit. Parks Canada and STS are the likely defendants, but such a suit might do little more than extend the grief. A change in Canadian law in November eliminated potential earnings as a reward in civil filings, meaning that the pain of reliving the event would net each family only about U.S. $50,000. "Everyone looks for someone to blame, whether it's for the avalanches or the space shuttle," says Seibert, the survivor of the Jan. 20 slide. "We have this belief that safety is guaranteed, and that is ludicrous. I hope that if something had happened to me, my wife would have been happy knowing I didn't die watching CNN." That same mind-set is what administrators at Strathcona-Tweedsmuir remain determined to cultivate in the school's students. "We will be investigating and likely adding procedures for risk assessment, but this program is at the heart of who we are and how we educate and develop young people," Healy says. "It won't end."

When they didn't respond clearly, Blakstvedt checked their avalanche transceiver and realized there were several more people under the snow.The four spent nearly an hour digging to find just one victim, a teenage boy who was under about three metres of snow."We dug up one, but we had signals everywhere, you've got to pick one," he said. "Just that one body took us an hour to get to."It took about 50 minutes for rescue helicopters to arrive on the scene. At its height, the rescue effort included more than 30 people and seven helicopters, along with rescue dogs from nearby Banff National Park.Blakstvedt, 34, said he and his friend witnessed the avalanche from a vantage point high up a mountain. They saw it sweep down one slope. It was so big it swept up another slope before sweeping down the valley towards the class that was skiing."As I was heading to the top of the bowl up in the treeline, I heard a big thunder and saw the slide," he said.Officials said the slide started on a ridge in Connaught Creek, on the opposite side of the valley from the ski party.Glacier Park wardens said the two guides had greeted the skiers moments earlier, then moved on.Moments later, the guides looked back across the valley to see a huge "dust cloud" of snow cascading down the mountain, with the young skiers in its path."They warned the party with a shout of 'Avalanche!' . . . but it engulfed them," said Eric Dafoe, a park warden who assisted in the rescue.Back-country guide Richard Marshall yelled "Avalanche!" three times in the four to five seconds the huge snowslide rumbled down the north face of Mt. Cheops.Marshall and fellow guide Abby Watkins, who had been having lunch in the trees opposite, skied frantically down to find a hand sticking out of the snow.Marshall and Watkins dug out that person, who happened to be the trip's guide and a school staff member."He had a satellite cellphone and that was used to call out for help," said Dafoe.The three then dug out several other members of the group.Dafoe's fellow park warden, Jordy Shetherd, co-ordinated the on-site rescue. "The first person was dug out within five minutes," said Shetherd said. "Within 40 minutes, all but three were pulled to the surface."Within two hours, all the party were accounted for.Shetherd also said as victims were pulled from the snow, they grabbed shovels and frantically joined in the search.Meanwhile Parks Canada, the RCMP and a military unit stationed in the area mounted a rescue operation Dafoe described as heroic."It started out as a small slide high up on the mountain seen by the two people up in the trees and as it went down it dug deeper and picked up more snow," Dafoe said. "From the time it let go to the time it hit was four to five seconds. The people involved had very little time to do anything before they got hit by the snow."He said the avalanche was "powerful enough to destroy a house or a train."~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~02/02/03Seven students swept to deaths on school ski tripCalgary-area teens' outing ends in disaster as party hit by giant wall of snowJohn Colebourn, Stuart Hunter, and Greg Middleton  The Province; with files from Canadian Press Sunday, February 02, 2003REVELSTOKE -- The second deadly avalanche to hit this area in as many weeks has claimed the lives of seven high school students from Alberta on a back-country ski excursion.Dead are six boys and one girl, all Grade 10 students at Strathcona-Tweedsmuir School, a small private school in Okotoks, about 20 kilometres south of Calgary.RCMP said 14 students from the school, out on an annual cross-country ski trip, were among 17 people caught in the slide late yesterday morning in this popular ski-touring area in east-central B.C. B.C. Ambulance Service spokesman Bob Pierce confirmed the deaths.The survivors were airlifted to Glacier Park Lodge by helicopter. Two people from the group were treated for minor injuries, said RCMP Sgt. Randy Brown.When the call for help came in from a cell phone, park wardens, RCMP officers and local ski-tour operators and guides, backed up by helicopters and search dogs, joined in the rescue effort.Members of a Canadian Horse Artillery unit stationed in the park for avalanche-control work were also on hand to assist.The slide occurred in Glacier National Park, about 65 kilometres east of Revelstoke, in the Rogers Pass area known as Knock Creek.The victims were in an outdoor education class, said Pam Doyle, superintendent for Parks Canada in Revelstoke.All three leaders of the group -- two male teachers and a male volunteer -- had certification and back-country experience, Macoun added.The group had been skiing about 15 metres apart, with one supervisor in front and the other two bringing up the rear. The skiers were halfway up the valley when the avalanche roared down the north slope, burying nearly the entire group. Several mountain guides out recreational skiing witnessed the slide and raced over to help."Nothing like this has ever happened here before," said John Jones, longtime manager of the Glacier Park Lodge. "It's devastating, of course. A lot of the people who ski here know people involved in the last avalanche. It's a double blow."Last night, teary-eyed children at a local hotel could be heard placing frantic calls home to assure parents they were safe.Parents began arriving last night.Yesterday's slide, 500 to 800 metres wide, was the second major slide in the area in a month. Seven people in a party of 21 back-country skiers died in a Jan. 20 avalanche on Durrand Glacier..The avalanche yesterday occurred on Mount Cheops in Glacier National Park just before noon.Doyle said it swept the north face of the mountain in the Connaught Creek Valley section of Balu Valley, about five kilometres west of the Rogers Pass summit. The area is not particularly remote and features well-marked cross-country ski trails. No guides are needed to ski in the area."It's a very, very popular ski destination site," said Pat Dunn, media liaison officer at the national park.The Saturday-morning back-country avalanche report listed the hazard for the park as "considerable" in both the treeline and alpine areas.Doyle said there are no plans yet to close back-country areas of the park.Evan Manners, operations manager of the Canadian Avalanche Centre here, said yesterday's avalanche rating was about half way along the five-level rating system. But he added it was ideal conditions for an avalanche -- clear conditions just after a storm system passed through the area."Statistically, this is exactly the time when we see the majority of accidents in the few days following a storm," Manners said.Manners added that two significant slides in such a short period is not unusual.Whether the circumstances surrounding the avalanche that swept down the mountainside yesterday near Rogers Pass is any different than those during the killer avalanche two weeks ago is uncertain.What is clear is that an average of 13 people die in avalanches every year in Canada, mostly in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta and B.C. The death toll, and the promise of more to come as the popularity of backcountry touring grows, is raising questions about what can be done to avert accidents.Researchers, backcountry enthusiasts, and mountain guides argue the government must spend more money to research avalanches. But others suggest that it is simply too difficult to predict when and where an avalanche will take place.***********************7 Students Die in Canadian Avalanche THE ASSOCIATED PRESS REVELSTOKE, British Columbia -- Another avalanche in a region of eastern British Columbia killed seven skiers Saturday -- all of them high-school students, authorities said. The dead were six boys and one girl, all in grade 10 at the Strathcona-Tweedsmuir School, a private institution about 12 miles south of Calgary, Alberta. "We are absolutely stricken with grief. Our hearts go out to all those who are impacted," said Tony Macoun, head of the school. There were 17 people in the school group, three adults and 14 students in an outdoor education class, on their annual cross-country ski trip. The leaders of the group were two male teachers and a male volunteer. All three leaders had certification and backcountry experience, Macoun said. The 10 survivors were airlifted to Glacier Park Lodge by helicopter, said Bob Pearce of the British Columbia Ambulance Service. One was hospitalized and some others suffered minor injuries, a Glacier Park spokesperson said. Names and further details about the victims were not available until next of kin could be notified. The slide occurred just before noon Saturday in the Rogers Pass area of Glacier National Park in western Canada. The avalanche, which ran for about a mile, was capable of destroying 10 acres of forest, said Pat Dunn, a Parks Canada spokeswoman. Two mountain guides, who had just passed the students, saw the avalanche and warned them before it hit, park warden Jordy Shepherd said. They were the first to help dig the victims out after the slide engulfed the group. Some victims were buried under about 9 feet of snow, Dunn said. As many as seven helicopters helped in the rescue effort. It was second major avalanche in the Revelstoke area in 12 days. A Jan. 20 avalanche in the same region killed seven people -- four Canadians and three Americans, including snowboard pioneer Craig Kelly. A memorial service for those victims was held Friday.

Kip Wiley They were marching up the valley in pairs, their eyes alternating between the two feet of fresh powder under their skis and their destination: the top of the Balu Pass Trail, a ribbon of snow 550 yards wide in British Columbia's Glacier National Park. The valley is named after the creek that parts it, the Connaught, but residents call the primary ski route through this remote part of western Canada simply Balu. One of North America's most popular backcountry recreation areas, the Connaught Valley is moderately difficult to ski and was well known to the 14 high school students moving up its north side on Feb. 1. They were children of privilege, 10th-graders at the prestigious Strathcona-Tweedsmuir School (STS) outside Calgary, Alberta. A four-day trip to the Rogers Pass area of Glacier National Park, which includes Balu, had been a tradition at STS for more than 20 years. And for this year's group -- 14 students, two teacher-guides and another adult -- Day Two held great promise. The temperature was approaching 30¡ when they left the Rogers Pass information center shortly after 9:30 a.m., and although clouds hid the ridge tops, windows of blue sky gave the air a welcoming crispness. Watching the group ski up the valley were Rich Marshall and his wife, Abby Watkins, professional guides from Golden, B.C. They had stopped for tea in some timber at 5,500 feet, and as they stood sipping from thermoses, they could see the students about 300 feet below, a twisting line of earth tones in their Gore-Tex jackets and snug hats slowly ascending the same broken trail that Marshall and Watkins had skied. At 11:45, as Marshall was closing his thermos, he heard a sharp crack from across the valley, from the menacing north-facing slope of Mount Cheops, a peak considered too steep to ski. Marshall saw the snowpack at approximately 7,900 feet give way and begin a screaming descent toward the students and their guides. "Avalanche! Avalanche! Avalanche!" he yelled. The students had only seconds before the monstrous slide, estimated at more than 850 yards wide and moving with enough force to flatten 10 acres of forest, hit. First came a "wall of snow," one student later told wardens, and then "blackness." Marshall and Watkins were dusted by the avalanche and waited for it to settle before speeding toward the group. Investigators would later conclude that the couple saved at least five lives. But there would be little solace in that fact. While seven youngsters and three adults survived the avalanche, another seven motivated and promising teenagers -- six boys and one girl -- died. As funerals were held last week, much of what Calgary learned about the lost students came from thumbnail sketches in the newspapers. Ben Albert was a hockey and volleyball player; Daniel Arato, an eccentric who rode a unicycle; Scott Broshko, a trumpet player and four-sport athlete; Alex Patillo, a lover of the theater; Michael Shaw, a computer whiz who favored sailing; Jeff Trickett, a witty saxophone player; and Marissa Staddon, a figure skater who loved climbing with her father. The loss of young life leveled the community and sparked a debate over the value of outdoor programs at schools like Strathcona-Tweedsmuir -- a debate that was played out, wrenchingly, even at the victims' funerals. "What kind of character are we trying to build by this type of adventure -- Rambos?" said Arato's grandfather, John Konig, during the service for his grandson. The next day 17-year-old Amanda Shaw, Michael's older sister, stepped to the podium at Christ Church and gave STS a much-needed vote of confidence. "Nobody could have predicted it; nobody could have prevented it," said Amanda, who went on an earlier Rogers Pass trip. "It's a great character-building program." Parks Canada has come under fire as well. On Jan. 20 an avalanche on the Durrand Glacier, 20 miles from Rogers Pass, had buried 13 skiers and snowboarders, killing seven. Among the dead were four Americans -- Kathleen Kessler of Truckee, Calif.; Dennis Yates of Los Angeles; Ralph Lunsford of Littleton, Colo.; and world-champion snowboarder Craig Kelly of Mount Vernon, Wash. The death toll for these two avalanches is equal to the average number of avalanche deaths in Canada for the past five winters. Says Peter Arato, Daniel's father, "When a tragedy is called an accident, it implies it was unavoidable. But what happens in life is never that black and white." There is no gray when it comes to how Canadians feel about their right to explore their national parks. While there is no way to track the number of Canadians who venture into the wild, "it is clear that number is growing rapidly," said Ross Cloutier, a mountain guide who chairs the adventure programs department at University College of the Cariboo in Kamloops, B.C. "It is what this generation wants to do." The most recent avalanche has spurred Parks Canada to review how it keeps adventurers safe, but parks officials and outdoor enthusiasts scoff at taking more-radical steps such as closing areas deemed hazardous. "You can't regulate the backcountry," says Cloutier. "You can't lock it up." The controversy swirling around the school programs won't pass easily. Whether the 14 STS students should have been on the mountain has been debated not only during eulogies but also in classrooms and at dinner tables, in the Irish pubs on Calgary's bustling 8th Avenue and in mountain towns such as Revelstoke, B.C., home to the coroner who has investigated all 14 deaths in this year's two avalanches. Outdoor excursions at STS and at other schools across Canada have been canceled or postponed as officials and families ponder whether learning the lessons that nature teaches is worth putting children in harm's way. "How this debate goes will determine if mountain adventure programs are viable," said Dan Murphy, principal at Banff (Alberta) Mountain Academy, which canceled some trips after Feb. 1. "We can only hope," says Alf Skrastins, director of outdoor programs at the University of Calgary, "that the people doing the criticizing understand the role nature can play in children's lives." That role is defined early at Strathcona-Tweedsmuir. Initiation for first-grade students includes a weekend during which they sleep in tents on campus, which covers 170 acres in the eastern foothills of the Rockies. They learn environmental tenets such as "leave it as you found it" and are introduced to places on campus where they can hike, ski, canoe, rock climb or otherwise explore. High school and junior high students participate in trips of several days, such as the excursion to Rogers Pass, which was part of a for-credit course for 10th-graders. "The outdoor education program has made such a difference," says Christine Kolanos, a former member of the school's volunteer board who sent all four of her children to STS. "It teaches students the drive, desire and dedication needed to succeed in life." All those attributes were possessed by the 14 students who left Calgary on the last day of January. The teenagers also appear to have been well versed on the potential dangers in Glacier National Park. On Friday, as the group's vans rode the four hours to Rogers Pass, they passed avalanche warning signs and went through five long tunnels built because constant slides had buried the highway. Once in Rogers Pass, the students skied for 20 minutes from the highway to A.O. Wheeler Hut, a three-bedroom log cabin maintained by the Alpine Club of Canada.

When they didn't respond clearly, Blakstvedt checked their avalanche transceiver and realized there were several more people under the snow.The four spent nearly an hour digging to find just one victim, a teenage boy who was under about three metres of snow."We dug up one, but we had signals everywhere, you've got to pick one," he said.

"Within 40 minutes, all but three were pulled to the surface."Within two hours, all the party were accounted for.Shetherd also said as victims were pulled from the snow, they grabbed shovels and frantically joined in the search.Meanwhile Parks Canada, the RCMP and a military unit stationed in the area mounted a rescue operation Dafoe described as heroic."It started out as a small slide high up on the mountain seen by the two people up in the trees and as it went down it dug deeper and picked up more snow," Dafoe said. "From the time it let go to the time it hit was four to five seconds. The people involved had very little time to do anything before they got hit by the snow."He said the avalanche was "powerful enough to destroy a house or a train."~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~02/02/03Seven students swept to deaths on school ski tripCalgary-area teens' outing ends in disaster as party hit by giant wall of snowJohn Colebourn, Stuart Hunter, and Greg Middleton  The Province; with files from Canadian Press Sunday, February 02, 2003REVELSTOKE -- The second deadly avalanche to hit this area in as many weeks has claimed the lives of seven high school students from Alberta on a back-country ski excursion.Dead are six boys and one girl, all Grade 10 students at Strathcona-Tweedsmuir School, a small private school in Okotoks, about 20 kilometres south of Calgary.RCMP said 14 students from the school, out on an annual cross-country ski trip, were among 17 people caught in the slide late yesterday morning in this popular ski-touring area in east-central B.C. B.C. Ambulance Service spokesman Bob Pierce confirmed the deaths.The survivors were airlifted to Glacier Park Lodge by helicopter. Two people from the group were treated for minor injuries, said RCMP Sgt. Randy Brown.When the call for help came in from a cell phone, park wardens, RCMP officers and local ski-tour operators and guides, backed up by helicopters and search dogs, joined in the rescue effort.Members of a Canadian Horse Artillery unit stationed in the park for avalanche-control work were also on hand to assist.The slide occurred in Glacier National Park, about 65 kilometres east of Revelstoke, in the Rogers Pass area known as Knock Creek.The victims were in an outdoor education class, said Pam Doyle, superintendent for Parks Canada in Revelstoke.All three leaders of the group -- two male teachers and a male volunteer -- had certification and back-country experience, Macoun added.The group had been skiing about 15 metres apart, with one supervisor in front and the other two bringing up the rear. The skiers were halfway up the valley when the avalanche roared down the north slope, burying nearly the entire group. Several mountain guides out recreational skiing witnessed the slide and raced over to help."Nothing like this has ever happened here before," said John Jones, longtime manager of the Glacier Park Lodge. "It's devastating, of course. A lot of the people who ski here know people involved in the last avalanche. It's a double blow."Last night, teary-eyed children at a local hotel could be heard placing frantic calls home to assure parents they were safe.Parents began arriving last night.Yesterday's slide, 500 to 800 metres wide, was the second major slide in the area in a month. Seven people in a party of 21 back-country skiers died in a Jan. 20 avalanche on Durrand Glacier..The avalanche yesterday occurred on Mount Cheops in Glacier National Park just before noon.Doyle said it swept the north face of the mountain in the Connaught Creek Valley section of Balu Valley, about five kilometres west of the Rogers Pass summit. The area is not particularly remote and features well-marked cross-country ski trails. No guides are needed to ski in the area."It's a very, very popular ski destination site," said Pat Dunn, media liaison officer at the national park.The Saturday-morning back-country avalanche report listed the hazard for the park as "considerable" in both the treeline and alpine areas.Doyle said there are no plans yet to close back-country areas of the park.Evan Manners, operations manager of the Canadian Avalanche Centre here, said yesterday's avalanche rating was about half way along the five-level rating system. But he added it was ideal conditions for an avalanche -- clear conditions just after a storm system passed through the area."Statistically, this is exactly the time when we see the majority of accidents in the few days following a storm," Manners said.Manners added that two significant slides in such a short period is not unusual.Whether the circumstances surrounding the avalanche that swept down the mountainside yesterday near Rogers Pass is any different than those during the killer avalanche two weeks ago is uncertain.What is clear is that an average of 13 people die in avalanches every year in Canada, mostly in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta and B.C. The death toll, and the promise of more to come as the popularity of backcountry touring grows, is raising questions about what can be done to avert accidents.Researchers, backcountry enthusiasts, and mountain guides argue the government must spend more money to research avalanches. But others suggest that it is simply too difficult to predict when and where an avalanche will take place.***********************7 Students Die in Canadian Avalanche THE ASSOCIATED PRESS REVELSTOKE, British Columbia -- Another avalanche in a region of eastern British Columbia killed seven skiers Saturday -- all of them high-school students, authorities said. The dead were six boys and one girl, all in grade 10 at the Strathcona-Tweedsmuir School, a private institution about 12 miles south of Calgary, Alberta. "We are absolutely stricken with grief. Our hearts go out to all those who are impacted," said Tony Macoun, head of the school. There were 17 people in the school group, three adults and 14 students in an outdoor education class, on their annual cross-country ski trip. The leaders of the group were two male teachers and a male volunteer. All three leaders had certification and backcountry experience, Macoun said. The 10 survivors were airlifted to Glacier Park Lodge by helicopter, said Bob Pearce of the British Columbia Ambulance Service. One was hospitalized and some others suffered minor injuries, a Glacier Park spokesperson said. Names and further details about the victims were not available until next of kin could be notified. The slide occurred just before noon Saturday in the Rogers Pass area of Glacier National Park in western Canada. The avalanche, which ran for about a mile, was capable of destroying 10 acres of forest, said Pat Dunn, a Parks Canada spokeswoman. Two mountain guides, who had just passed the students, saw the avalanche and warned them before it hit, park warden Jordy Shepherd said. They were the first to help dig the victims out after the slide engulfed the group. Some victims were buried under about 9 feet of snow, Dunn said. As many as seven helicopters helped in the rescue effort. It was second major avalanche in the Revelstoke area in 12 days. A Jan. 20 avalanche in the same region killed seven people -- four Canadians and three Americans, including snowboard pioneer Craig Kelly. A memorial service for those victims was held Friday.

CBC.CA - The NationalWorst-case scenarioAvalanche kills seven teens in B.C. backcountryReporter: Margo McDiarmidFebruary 24, 2003On February 1, 2003, seven Calgary families learned of the deaths of their teenage children and an entire country grieved with them. Scott Broshko, Marissa Staddon, Ben Albert, Daniel Arato, Alex Patillo, Michael Shaw and Jeff Trickett were killed during a high school ski trip, swept to their deaths by a massive avalanche.It was an unimaginable tragedy, both for the parents who saw their children off that fateful day and for the people who tried desperately to rescue them.It all started on a Friday morning in a Calgary parking lot. Three teachers and 14 students embarked on the school trip they had been looking forward to: backcountry skiing.Scott BroshkoDonna Broshko's son Scott was among the group. "They were just so excited and happy to go," she says. "It sounded like they were just going to have the time of their lives. It was just another one of the trips, right? You know, it was: 'Have fun. Love you.' You know, that kind of stuff, right? But never, I wasn't really ever thinking any grave potential danger. I mean, trust me, if it would've been, you know, mama bear would've never let him go."A young Marissa StaddonKarl Staddon described his daughter, Marissa."Marissa was bubbly and upbeat and she had on her red bibbed ski pants and had on her Gore-Tex, red Gore-Tex, top and her green pack and we drove over to the Canadian Tire on Richmond Road," he said."I got to tell you that my wife, when we left our house, she stood at the doorway to the garage and was very concerned and was tearing up because of just concerns about safety," he said."Marissa gave me a big hug and nestled her head against my neck and said, 'Dad, Ilove you.' And I said 'Marissa, I love you too.' And I said, 'have a great trip.' And that was the last time I saw her alive."The skiers went to British Columbia's Glacier National Park, one of the most popular places in the world for backcountry adventure. Enthusiasts can trek up trails into the steep mountains and bowls of untouched snow. It's a skier's paradise.It's also avalanche country. The students and their teachers knew that and trained for it. What they didn't know was that they were about to ski into the worst-case scenario."Marissa gave me a big hug and nestled her head against my neck and said, 'Dad, I love you."Rick MarshallSaturday morning was day two of the trip, and the group headed up a popular trail into a mountain valley. There were a number of other skiers in the area that day. Rick Marshall was one of them."I think it was probably around 10:30 or something like that when we left the car and headed up the Connaught Creek drainage," he said. "And we were, you know, there's a few people ahead of us, we realized on the trail and, you know, we started passing a few groups and some groups were going off into another drainage to ski and they came across the school group and passed them," he said."We just started off from our break. We noticed an avalanche coming down off the north face of Mount Cheops and that's when we realized that there was, you know, a good group (of skiers) was below, in the path of it," he said."We actually yelled to them that there was an avalanche coming down off of Cheops," said Marshall. "We actually witnessed the avalanche hit a couple of the front members of the group."Abby WatkinsAbby Watkins also saw the avalanche. "Within seconds, I had the realization that it was going to be very big," she said. "I had a question as to whether we were safe because we were straight across from it.""And then we just braced for what was going to happen. And then we were hit by the powder cloud," said Watkins."Right off the bat, I could see that there were people caught in it," said Marshall. "And then, you know, I saw a hand sticking out and, you know, a leg further over and somebody partially buried.""There was little chance that I could save everybody," said Watkins. "You just have to save as many people as possible.""There was little chance that I could save everybody," said Watkins. "You just have to save as many people as possible."Within an hour, seven helicopters, 48 people and three search dogs were on the scene. But Rick Marshall got there first."I went to the person with the hand sticking out," he said. "That just happened to be Andrew, the group leader and he had a cellphone on him - not a cellphone but a satellite phone - and so we radioed (Parks personnel)."Eric DafoeEric Dafoe was avalanche rescue commander that day. "I got the call from dispatch in Rogers Pass and said you're going to work," he said. "My initial reaction (was), 'this is really serious, and we've got to act quickly.'"Dafoe met Jordy Shepherd, an avalanche site rescue leader, and they flew to the scene by helicopter."This was our worst-case scenario," said Shepherd. "A large natural avalanche in a busy area that hit a large group. That type of dry slab avalanche can generally reach speeds of 150 to 200 kilometres an hour and it actually pushes a pillow of wind in front of it."Sylvain HebertSylvain Hebert, a heli-ski guide and rescuer, was skiing nearby at the time of the avalanche."I had just been dropped off on top of a run and I'd skied maybe 20 turns and I got a call on the radio from our radio dispatch telling me that there was an avalanche at Rogers Pass and that they needed our help," he said. "I just grabbed the shovel and shovelled as well."Jordy ShepherdShepherd and Dafoe credit a number of guides, including Hebert, Marshall and Watkins with rescuing several of the victims."(Watkins and Marshall) were probably responsible for saving five people's lives," said Dafoe."Marshall said he had no choice but to act quickly. "A slide that powerful and with that kind of snow density, you know, you only have five, 10 minutes," he said. "There were no air pockets in the snow. You're just holding your breath."Marshall said some victims were conscious, and some were not."In a situation like that, you just, you give 'er and you don't stop," he said. You're on                  adrenalin and, you know, you dig hard and you search hard and you just try and get the job done as fast as you can."Watkins said it was difficult to deal with the fact that some of the teens weren't alive when they got to them."Every face I saw like that, I realized that there was a family attached, that this was going to devastate that family," she said.As the rescue progressed, the winds picked up and conditions turned dangerous. Marshall said he and the other rescuers worried another avalanche would hit them."We were a little concerned, you know, why this avalanche started," he said. "The winds                  were a little higher now and we were concerned for our own safety as well."The rescuers beat an orderly retreat."Our world had stopped."Donna Broshko remembered how she heard about the avalanche."I'm going out the back way, out the garage door, and the phone rings and it's the headmaster from school, and he said, 'Donna, there's been an accident.'""I said OK, well, is everybody okay? And he says, 'Oh no, unfortunately not.' I say, well what do you mean unfortunately not?' Or something like that. And he said, 'Well, there's been some fatalities.'"And he says 'Oh, there's been such a tragedy.' And I was like, 'cut to the chase.' Like I've (had enough waiting). Like I just, no more peripheral stuff, like just tell me how Scott is. Hesays 'I'm really sorry, he's one of the victims.' Well, that was like, it was like phenomenal. It was like, like just such disbelief. Just no, no. Just no. Just no."Karl StaddonKarl Staddon also got the call. "I asked for the RCMP's number in Revelstoke, which he provided to me," he said. "And so I called and I spoke with Officer Sommerville who also was very gracious. And he, I told him who I was. I was the father of one of the students involved in the trip - I understand there's been an avalanche and wondered if he could fill me in.""And then he paused and he said, 'you should brace yourself for the worst possible outcome.' And my heart about leapt out of my chest. And then he went on to say, and again with great compassion and care, he said that 'there are nine students that are accounted for, or alive and accounted for. Your daughter is not on that list. But we cannot say with 100 per cent certainty that she's deceased at this stage,'" he said."We were numbed, to be honest," said Staddon. "Truly numbed. Just could not believe it. Our world had stopped."Janice PinkertonAs the families struggled to cope with the tragedy, Revelstoke resident Janice Pinkerton  a member of Revelstoke Victims' Services  opened her home to the survivors."A lot of them had bangs in their faces and their ears and they didn't look like they had been, they were wounded, but they were definitely hurt," she said."And they talked about hotels and that, and that didn't strike me, that struck me wrong. So I said that I had a house that was more than big enough and I'm sure I could find enough blankets and sleeping bags and beds and…they could sleep there," she said."The memory I'll have is their faces, their ears, because they had, a lot of them had like swollen faces," she said. "And how they huddled. How they were always together. And they, it was almost like they moved as a group and I thought that that was, that was very powerful to me, that they were so, so focused on each other," she said.In Calgary, normal life stopped. Seven funerals in less than a week. The city ran out of flowers.Donna BroshkoAt her son Scott's funeral, Donna Broshko carried his ashes in an urn. "I thought 'I'm his mother. I carried him for nine months. I can carry him out. I can do this,' you know. And I did it. I just, I can do this, right? It's something you can do for your child, right?"Karl Staddon reflected on the funeral for his daughter Marissa."When I wrote the funeral card, I looked at some of the other cards and you know, people live to be 75 or 85, and 15 years seemed so incredibly short," he said. "And I did the math and Marissa was with us for 5,712 days. That sounded better. And they were glorious days."Strathcona-Tweedsmuir School launched an investigation into the tragic school trip, and it is reviewing its outdoor education program that is the cornerstone of the private school's philosophy. In the meantime, all other school trips are cancelled.Donna Broshko says she doesn't blame the school for her son's death. "In my heart, (I) believe that they did do everything that they could do, you know. Sometimes things happen in life, right?""Sometimes things happen in life, right?"Staddon agrees. I'm at peace with the decision-making by the trip leaders that particular day," he said. "And I'm satisfied that this is a very rare occurrence of this magnitude that involved a school group."Jordy Shepherd said that the group did everything right."This group was, they were very well prepared and, and it was an unfortunate                  circumstance that they were, they were there at that time," he said.But the four seconds that wiped out seven young lives will leave lasting scars, not just on the school and the families, but also on the people who fought to save the skiers, and the B.C. community that poured its heart out to the survivors.Watch part one of Margo McDiarmid's report (runs 18:09)Watch part two of Margo McDiarmid's report (runs 5:05)YOUR TURNSend your commentsINDEPTHCanada's deadly avalanchesWeak snow with a heavy wallopSTORIESDeaths mark worst year for fatalities in Glacier National Park (Feb. 3, 2003)Avalanche risk is never zero, says Parks Canada (Feb. 3, 2003)B.C. avalanche victims buried under four metres of snow (Jan. 21, 2003)EXTERNAL LINKSCanadian Avalanche AssociationU.S. and world avalanche statisticsUniversity of Calgary: Applied snow and avalanche research(CBC does not endorse and is not responsible for the content of external sites.)WATCH THE NATIONAL10:00 PM LOCAL TIMEon the CBC network9:0010:00 PM ETon CBC NewsworldHome | About the National | Our Hosts and Reporters | Transcripts | Contact Us#*#CBC.CA - The National#*#- End Top Nav Bar -#*#Worst-case scenarioAvalanche kills seven teens in B.C. backcountryReporter: Margo McDiarmidFebruary 24, 2003#*#On February 1, 2003, seven Calgary families learned of the deaths of their teenage children and an entire country grieved with them.

capacity and natural ability for it.  And a year ago was sortof the highlight of her skating time in that she did manage to go to Canadianjunior national competition.  She glowed when she was on the ice Thisis Marissa with her younger sister, Brittany, who she loved and adored.We had a lot of great times as family together.   This is inthe mountains.  We started when they were very young taking tripsto the mountains. (fewmore family vacation photos )Wewent up Heart Mountain which is just east of Canmore, by Lacktahs Arch. Marissa was ten years of age at that time.  I think its 2,500 feetof net vertical.Hereshe is at the top. Memoriesof the mountains, and a mountain that forever changed this family. Headlines// the helicopter // the mountains in black and whiteNowthe memories of mountains are very different. Thiswas Marissas backpack that she took on the outdoor education trip whereshe was struck by the avalanche.  It was purchased new, this year,and fitted to her.  She was still wearing it when she was buried. She was buried about two and a half metres below the surface wearing thebackpack.  Tough going through it.  I will show you some of thearticles that she had in that backpack on the day she was struck. Karland Donna Staddon have found themselves unpacking a storm of grief sincetheir daughter Marissas school, Stratchona Tweedsmuir, had its outdooreducation trip turned to tragedy.Atthe time when we hear the news that Marissa was deceased, Brittanys responseat that time was oh, Ive lost my very best friend and she said Marissahas taught me so much and I was looking forward to having her teach memore and more, Im gonna miss her so.   And then she paused anda few minutes later Brittany spoke up and she said, well, wouldnt youknow, Marissa was always such a competitor, and always looking to go forthe gold, and here shes won this race, shes beat us all to heaven. Sevenstudents, all 15 years old, died in the avalanche and sent their home city,Calgary, reeling.  It hits not just parents, it hits siblings. I mean this covers every relationship group, siblings, friends, parents,grandparents, everybody felt a sense of loss.LiciaCorbella is an editor at the Calgary Sun. Youknow that I dont want to use a cliché, but it was an avalancheof grief.  First there was the shuttle astronauts that perished. And then later that day there was another group of 7 bright lights justdisappeared.  And being that they were young people, and such connectedyoung people, so involved in so many things, it didnt seem that therewas any person in this city who didnt know someone who knew someone whoknew them.  Or who knew them personally.  Everybody just gotthat sick sense in their feeling of so much potential lost.  Therewas a deep sense of sombreness in the city.  It really made the wholecity seem smaller in an odd sense.  Like a village.  Becauseeverybody was connected in some way.  It was verywell anytime youngpeople die, but to have 7 at the same time all 15 years old, all grade10 students, all of them remarkable young people with so much promise,it was just shocking.Itsbeen Canadas worst season for avalanche deaths.A mildwinter created the most unstable snow pack Revelstoke had seen in thirtyyears.  A reality that claimed 14 lives in 14 days. Thisis an avalanche transceiver.  All of the students and the adults onthe trip would have been wearing one of these.  You put these aroundyour waist and over your shoulder to keep them secure.  When thethisis kind of like a key when its engaged in this, you can see, it startsto blink.  The number of blinks gives you a indication of the batterylife.  And you travel with it in transmit mode.  And it sendsout about every second a small radio frequency.  And in the eventof an avalanche everyone who is above ground or above snow, then switchestheir transceiver from transmit to receive.  And you then go abouttrying to locate with this the people that are buried.   go downto confirm exactly where theyre at.  Because you dont want to diga deep hole to find out that you dug three feet off of where theyre located. So this is how they are used.  And how some of the students were detectedand saved as a result, by the transceiver.Thatday in Revelstoke it wasnt human activity that began the avalanche, itwas wind.  Over a kilometre long crack in the snow loosening itselffrom the mountain. Experiencedin wilderness trips, the Staddons have gone over all the details of thistragedy Weviewed Marissas body at the funeral home and she looked very much at peace,and at rest it gave us a certain measure of comfort that the avalancheitself hadnt caused he a lot of pain, from what we understand and havingflown over the site later that day, she wasnt swept through trees, shewasnt swept over cliffs, but she was swept a long distance 4-500 metreswere told from the point she was standing at or skiing at the time shewas struck by the avalanche, our firm belief is that while she was probablyvery frightened undoubtedly, that she didnt suffer a lot of pain, in theaftermath of the avalanche. Sowe drove up to Rogers pass and Donna, Brittany and myself together withJordy Sheppard who was the Parks Canada incident scene commander and thehelicopter pilot we flew over the scene for 20 or 25 minutes.  Whilewe were over the scene and it will help us you know go back and locatethe site pretty precisely where Marissa came to rest after the avalanche.Couldyou see it from the air?Absolutely,it was a huge hole, I mean most of the holes were huge.  Marissa wasburied were told 2 metres down and so they dug out a big pit to reachout her body Myunderstanding is that uh at the time of the avalanche the trip leader wasburied save except for his hand which was above the snow, we spoke withhim the morning after the avalanche, he said that he could feel himselfblacking out so time was getting away from him as well and Rich and Abbybeing first on scene saw the hand and were able to scoop down to his faceand restore his breathing...7 helicopters were brought to bear over thescene in very short order there were 35 professionals on the ground involvedin the location digging and in attempted revival efforts and the kids dugas well... the kids dug as well because there was a time lag between thetime that the satellite phone call went out and the time Parks Canada arrived. Further up the mountain where the avalanche started and you can see howmuch snow really fed into this avalanche my estimate and Ive also readthat Parks Canada I believe have said they estimate in the thousands oftons of snow that came down Parks Canada personnel have also commenteduh think in terms of speeds of 160-200 km an hour.I believeIm told and I cant recall whether it was 37 or 47 shovels were brokenby the rescuers in trying to dig and extricate those that were buried bythe avalanche so again it speaks volumes to the effort, the Herculean effortof the rescuers to try to dig these kids out and revive themMarissaalways had a disposable camera in her back pack so she could take picturesof her adventures, and when we got her back pack back, her camera was thereand so we took it in and had the film developed, and theres a photo herethat wouldve been taken the day before, so on the Friday afternoon whenthey were out skiing and its Marissa with the two other girls that werepart of the group, friends of hers and, and it just captures them withgreat smiles, and just enjoying their adventure Soare you at peace that the school had done everything it could that thiswas not beyond acceptable ?YesI am, and the reason is that I have climbed for over 20 yrs, Ive takenadvanced avalanche training Ive climbed in these sorts of conditions,I had the privilege of travelling with this group of students togetherwith the trip leader in the fall of 2002 and nothing came to light in allof our discussion on sun Feb 2nd with all of the personnel or subsequentto that date that has made me think that there was an error in human decisionmaking. I reallythink its remarkable that the first person dug out had the satellite phone. Its also incredibly remarkable that Rich and Abby, husband and wife, RichMarshall and Abby Watkins uh were just ahead, had passed the school group,and had just missed it, were able to come back and be the first personson scene after the avalanche and if not for their efforts the consequenceswouldve been considerably worse then they are Karl,as Im looking at the gear that she all had, and Im thinking about thistrip as it was about building character, helping students learn how toconquer challenges explain to us what you think goes on in the psyche ofa person as they learn to conquer nature?I canspeak from my own experience and I think most of the students if not allof the students were having similar experiences themselves.  Itsgreat for building confidence, it teaches you to prioritize, weight isalways an issue, the backpacks teaches you to be aware of the environmentthat youre operating in. Theseare transferrable life skills that you learn in the mountains.Absolutely,you develop a mind set of how you want to deal with risk and theres alsofor me and for most of these students that theres a sense of joyousnessof being in the mountains, you simply see things in the mountains thatyou do not see in the cities. Thisis the sleeping bag that Marissa took, its one that Ive had for manyyears, but is more than adequate for the purposes of this trip.......whenwe return...Unpackingwhat Marissa held in her heart. Part2 Allthe Calgary teenagers lost in the avalanche were seen as incredible youngCanadians, and Marissa Staddon lived life large. Andher friends were such a big part of her life.  They were a very closeknit group.  They had fun together.  Studied together. And theygrew in Christ together.  They are a group of friends who keep eachother accountable.  That was just so comforting as parents to knowthat the friends your daughter had were supporting and building, helpingher to build her relationship with Christ. Marissawas an avid athlete, not only in figure skating, but also with school sports,team sports.  Mainly volleyball, badminton, and track and field. She loved track and field and did very well in relay and long distance. And this particular photo was taken in June of 2002, her grade 9 year. Her friend gave us this photo.  And on it he wrote, on track for theLord.  And I just thought that was so wonderful.  Because thatwas indeed Marissa. Marissaplayed piano.  Started taking lessons when she was 7 years old. She was currently working on her grade 10 her grade 10 level of piano. Shealso played flute and clarinet and saxophone and also hand bells. She used her music for relaxation.  And then she would go of to skatingin the evening she went to the arena for two hours of skating each eveningI lovethis photoMarissa went on last year with her graduation grade 9 classfrom Glenmore Christian Academy in July to Mexico with Youth With A Mission. They  built a home for a needy family down there. Thispicture was taken of Marissa on conjunction with her graduation of juniorhigh in June of 2002.  Its actually the dress she had on for the funeralas well.Howdid you decide that?ActuallyI talked with Brittany, Marissas sister, and I said what dress do youthink.  And she said, oh mom, her graduation dress.  She lovedthat.  I can remember her putting it on and swirling around and going,ah this feels good.  Because both Brittany and I remember so wellher joy with that we just decided that that would be the dress we wouldhave for her funeral. Forher ultimate graduation.Forher ultimate graduation.  Perfect.  Yes. Wejust knew it had to be a celebration, and we also wanted to have the planof salvation to be spoken that word to be given to all who were going tobe there because Marissa lived her life solid in Christ and she was alwayshappy to share with others about Christ, the difference that was in herlife and so we wanted the message of salvation. (CelebrationService clip -Pastor Matheson)   God so loved you Marissa. God so loved you.  That he gave his only Son Jesus.  That Marissathat you might not perish.  So that you may have everlasting life. Marissaaccepted Christ into her heart when she was 4 years old, it was one daywhen I had picked her up from pre-school, she attended a pre-school ata local church and when I picked her up and put her into the van, she said,Mom, I asked Jesus into my heart today. And I said Oh Marissa, I am sooohappy for you.  Marissa did go on being keenly attuned to thingsof the Lord, reading her Bible, praying everyday, even through her teenyears, her Bible was always at her bed side, and she read every night beforeshe went to sleep.CelebrationService ClipWherewould you be without Him on this one? Despair. I think it would be despair, but when when we hold onto God, he understandsour pain, he understands our loss, he understands our confusion we sometimesfeel about all this too, but, uh there is not despair, what we have ishope, because um know that God will give us the strength to carry on, andthat we have the hope and the promise that we will be with Marissa againin heaven because we have asked Christ into our heart, we have that commitment,we have that assurance that we will be in heaven with God one day and thatmeans that were gonna be in heaven with Marissa too. And that,  justputs a whole different turn on the grieving that we are going through onthis journey because of the hope, the wonderful hope that hes given us.Andwhen you made your farewell card for Marissa, Karl you wrote it differentlythan most people, can you tell us why?Thewe uh look at some other precedents, maybe four or five, and most of theother precedents, were people who had lived to be maybe 75 or 80 or 85,Marissa only lived to15, and I thought that was such a pathetically shortamount small number and so I calculated the number of days including leapyears; it was 5712 days, that sounds like a lot, a lot better number Sowhat we wrote in our card was born June 13th 1987, Heaven bound Feb1st2003 Precious days 5712 and they truly were very very special days, wethink around Marissa, and donna and I were talking, and you know I guesstheres a couple things, one is two scenarios, one is we never had Marissaand the other is we had Marissa for that number of days, which would yourather have? No choice, absolutely would take those 5712 days with Marissathe second question, was Marissa ours, or was Marissa Gods gift to usfor whatever reason, and trusted to us to raise her up and its the later,she was Gods gift. Tributeclip from Celebration Service from a friend.Youthpastor Eryn Moore:    Theres no guarantees in life in termsof how long well actually live.  And I think that really caught alot of our students off guard.   A lot them really struggledwith it at first.  There was some anger, there was some questioningabout why God would allow something like this to happen.  SometimesI think the best answer is no answer.  Ive seen God work throughthis tragedy in amazing ways, but I couldnt say to these students, Godallowed Marissa to die so that these could happen. I dont know if thatwas totally His will.  I dont know.   I know that our livesare short.   That God never promises us any time of life on earth. Life is a gift. Thisis an assignment for language arts when she was in grade eight.  Itsa poetry project and they can choose any theme of their own that they wouldlike, and they have to write poems.  Marissa chose the theme of God. When her sister, when Brittany got this out of her closet and we read itthrough we realised howhow wonderful this was for us to have now. To have these poems Marissa wrote from her heart.  And they reflectedher closeness with God.  Her walk, her journey with God. Youhave a favourite in here, tell us why.YesI do have a favourite.  The favourite that I have is this free versewhich is called A Fresh Start.  Would it be all right if I read it. Sadly, standing in shimmering, sprinkling snow.  Shoulders down. Face downward.  Emotionally down cast.  She ponders, wonders,cries.  Tears walking round her face.  Covering all in theircourse, overcoming the sink before them.  Why is she alone? Why out in the snow?  Out in the cold?  Kneeling.  Bowing. Stumbling.  Fallen in the frost.  Hands grasp.  Eyes closed. Heart welcoming.  She finds a Redeemer.  A Saviour.  A freshstart. I reflectmore on it through the lens of the avalanche.  I dont know that itsprophecy but the parallels here are incredible.  Absolutely incredible. It touches me every time we look at it.Youhad a very unique way of letting Marissa say goodbye to her friends, itwas on a CD that she recorded, tell us about that. Wellin December of 2000 Marissa decided she wanted to put a compilation ofmusic together of contemporary Christian music and I encouraged her that I think it would be good to have a lead in voice section.  Itwas appropriate for the CD in Dec. 2000 and it was entirely appropriatefor her funeral service, her celebration service .... .....endingwith Marissa:  Jeremiah 29:11topof pageAllimages, text, and design copyrighted by Listen Up TV 2003 #*#doctype html public "-//w3c//dtd html 4.0 transitional//en"#*#Listen Up Program - Death in the Snow: An Avalanche Tragedy (Transcript - Part I - Apr 03/03)homepage  |  contactus!  |  search |  sitemap  |  prayerrequest  | Deathin the Snow:AnAvalanche TragedyTranscript- April 03, 2003Backto Main Page Itsbeen the worst season for avalanche deaths in over 20 years.

No choice, absolutely would take those 5712 days with Marissathe second question, was Marissa ours, or was Marissa Gods gift to usfor whatever reason, and trusted to us to raise her up and its the later,she was Gods gift. Tributeclip from Celebration Service from a friend.Youthpastor Eryn Moore:    Theres no guarantees in life in termsof how long well actually live.  And I think that really caught alot of our students off guard.   A lot them really struggledwith it at first.  There was some anger, there was some questioningabout why God would allow something like this to happen.  SometimesI think the best answer is no answer.  Ive seen God work throughthis tragedy in amazing ways, but I couldnt say to these students, Godallowed Marissa to die so that these could happen. I dont know if thatwas totally His will.  I dont know.   I know that our livesare short.   That God never promises us any time of life on earth. Life is a gift. Thisis an assignment for language arts when she was in grade eight.  Itsa poetry project and they can choose any theme of their own that they wouldlike, and they have to write poems.  Marissa chose the theme of God. When her sister, when Brittany got this out of her closet and we read itthrough we realised howhow wonderful this was for us to have now. To have these poems Marissa wrote from her heart.  And they reflectedher closeness with God.  Her walk, her journey with God. Youhave a favourite in here, tell us why.YesI do have a favourite.  The favourite that I have is this free versewhich is called A Fresh Start.  Would it be all right if I read it. Sadly, standing in shimmering, sprinkling snow.  Shoulders down. Face downward.  Emotionally down cast.  She ponders, wonders,cries.  Tears walking round her face.  Covering all in theircourse, overcoming the sink before them.  Why is she alone? Why out in the snow?  Out in the cold?  Kneeling.  Bowing. Stumbling.  Fallen in the frost.  Hands grasp.  Eyes closed. Heart welcoming.  She finds a Redeemer.  A Saviour.  A freshstart. I reflectmore on it through the lens of the avalanche.  I dont know that itsprophecy but the parallels here are incredible.  Absolutely incredible. It touches me every time we look at it.Youhad a very unique way of letting Marissa say goodbye to her friends, itwas on a CD that she recorded, tell us about that. Wellin December of 2000 Marissa decided she wanted to put a compilation ofmusic together of contemporary Christian music and I encouraged her that I think it would be good to have a lead in voice section.  Itwas appropriate for the CD in Dec. 2000 and it was entirely appropriatefor her funeral service, her celebration service .... .....endingwith Marissa:  Jeremiah 29:11topof pageAllimages, text, and design copyrighted by Listen Up TV 2003 #*#

At that time, it covered a much larger area than it does today. In 1819 and 1820, large portions of the county were removed to form the counties of Oakland, Lapeer, Genesee and St. Clair. The first Europeans arrived in the area during the 17 th century. They included French fur trappers who recognized the richness of the marshes and sought new opportunities for trade. Moravian missionaries established the first organized, non-native settlement in the county in 1782 as a refuge for Christianized Indians driven out of Ohio. They built along the banks of the Clinton River, then known as the Huron River, but were forced to leave four years later by the Chippewa Indians. In the late 1790s, Christian Clemens visited the area, and in March 1800, purchased a distillery considered the first building on the site of the future Mount Clemens. The next year he purchased 500 acres for development. This site, known as High Banks, was platted as the Village of Mount Clemens in 1818, when it was proclaimed the Macomb County Seat. In the early 1800s, and at least by 1840, settlers moved into the interior of the county, carving out farms from the hardwood forests. The roots of the county villages and townships were established by this time. In addition to the original French and English, later settlers included Germans, Belgians and others who came directly from Europe. In the 1870s, mineral baths brought international fame to Mount Clemens. Many believed the waters had healing powers. Although the stream still runs beneath the city, interest in the spas died out in the early 20 th century. Recently, there has been a reemergence of interest in the mineral baths now being offered at St. Joseph Hospital in Mount Clemens. Between 1920 and 1930, Macomb County doubled in population, rising from 38,103 to 77,146 persons. Two significant developments spurred this growth - the establishment of Selfridge Field in 1917, and the beginning of the urbanization movement northward from the City of Detroit. During the 1940s and the 1950s the movement from the central city to the suburbs increased. The largest growth occurred between 1950 and 1970, when over 440,000 people were added to Macomb County's population. Today, Macomb County encompasses 482 square miles, and ranks third in population in the state, with a 2000 census total of 788,149 persons. The county is recognized as a leader in business and industry, and designated as a "Community of Economic Excellence" by the State of Michigan.

C., in 1832. He emigrated to the United States in his youth, became a fur-merchant in Detroit, and was associated with John Jacob Astor, Elias Kane, and others. He subsequently removed to New York, and was engaged in shipping and speculations in landed estate, buying large tracts in Georgia, Kentucky, and North Carolina. In 1791 he bought of the state of New York 3,670,715 acres at about one shilling (one eighth of a dollar) an acre, on St. Lawrence river, including all the Thousand Islands that belonged to New York. This tract is known as "Macomb's purchase."--His son, Alexander, soldier, born in Detroit, Michigan, 3 April, 1782; died in Washington, D. C., 25 June, 1841, entered the army as a cornet of cavalry in 1799, was retained in the service after the partial disbanding of troops in 1802, became captain in 1805 and major in 1808, and at the beginning of the war of 1812 held the rank of lieutenant-colonel of engineers, and adjutant-general of the army. Finding his position unlikely to bring" him into active service, he was transferred to the artillery, and in 1813, as colonel of the 3d regiment of artillery, did effective service at Niagara and at Fort George. He was promoted brigadier-general in 1814, and placed in command of the northern frontier, bordering on Lake Champlain. At Plattsburg on 11 September of this year, while in command of 1,500 regular troops and some detachments of militia, he sustained the attack of a greatly superior British force under Sir George Provost, which, after the defeat of the British squadron on Lake Champlain on the same day, retreated to Canada. General Ma-comb was pro-rooted major-general for his conduct on this occasion, and received the thanks of congress and a gold medal. He was subsequently retained in the service as colonel of engineers, and, after the death of General Jacob Brown in 1835, succeeded to the office of commander-in-chief of the army. During the Florida war in 1835 he took the field for a short time. He was buried with military honors in the congressional cemetery in Washington, and his tomb is marked by a handsome monument. He published "A Treatise on Martial Law and Court-Martials as practised in the United States" (Charleston, 1809), and "A Treatise on the Practice of Court-Martials" (New York, 1840), and supervised Adjutant Samuel Cooper's "Tactics and Regulations for the Militia" (Philadelphia. 1836). See " Memoir of Alexander Macomb," by George H. Richards (New York, 1833).--His son, William Henry, naval officer, born in Detroit, Michigan, 16 June, 1818; died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 12 August, 1872, entered the navy as midshipman in 1834, and was commissioned lieutenant in 1847, commander in 1862, captain in 1866, and commodore in 1870. He commanded the sloop "Portsmouth," of the East India squadron, in 1856-'8, with which he was engaged in the capture of the barrier forts at Can-Con, China, under Commander Andrew H. Foote, on 16-22 November, 1856. He had charge of the "Metacomet" in the Paraguay expedition in 1859, and the steamer "Genesee" in 1862-'3, attempting the passage of the Confederate batteries at Port Hudson on 14 March of the latter year, and was in frequent actions in April and June, 1863. He commanded the "Shamrock." of the North Atlantic blockading squadron, in 1864-'5, and the naval force in the capture of Plymouth, North Carolina, on 30 October, 1864, and was advanced ten numbers in his grade for gallantry in this action and for that on Roanoke river, near Poplar Point, North Carolina. He was assigned to the steam sloop " Plymouth" of the European squadron, in 1869. His last service was that of lighthouse-inspector.Edited Appletons Encyclopedia, Copyright © 2001 VirtualologyTMStart your search on Alexander Macomb. Unauthorized Site:This site and its contents are not affiliated, connected,associated with or authorized by the individual, family,friends, or trademarked entities utilizing any part orthe subject's entire name.

Alexander Macomb, Jr. - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Alexander Macomb, Jr.From Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaJump to: navigation, search Alexander Macomb, Junior (3 April 1782 – 25 June 1841) was the commanding general of the United States Army from 29 May 1828 to 25 June 1841.General Macomb's official portraitBorn in Detroit, Michigan, Macomb was the son of Alexander Macomb, Sr..Macomb was commissioned in the Army Corps of Engineers in 1802 and spent 5 years in charge of coastal fortifications in the Carolinas and Georgia.He won acclaim during the War of 1812 as brigadier-general in command of the frontier of northern New York. At the Battle of Plattsburg on September 11, 1814 with only 1,500 regular troops and some detachments of militia, he repulsed an invasion attempt by a greatly superior British force under Sir George Prevost. General Macomb was promoted major-general for his conduct at this battle, receiving both the thanks of Congress and a gold medal.When Major General Jacob Brown, the Army’s commanding general, died in February 1828, President John Quincy Adams could have chosen as Brown's successor one of the Army's two brigadier generals. But the two — Winfield Scott and Edmund P. Gaines — had denounced each other publicly and for months had been contesting for the position. Their quarrels scandalized the Army and drove Adams to nominate Alexander Macomb, the Chief of Engineers, who by then had reverted rank to colonel, as the Army’s top general.His son was Commodore William H. Macomb.He died while in office in Washington, D.C. and is buried in the Congressional Cemetery.[edit] Congressional Gold Medal citationResolved, That the thanks of Congress be, and they are hereby presented to Major General Macomb, and, through him, to the officers and men of the regular army under his command, and to the militia and volunteers of New York and Vermont, for their gallantry and good conduct, in defeating the enemy at Plattsburg on the eleventh of September; repelling, with one thousand five hundred men, aided by a body of militia and volunteers from New York and Vermont, a British veteran army, greatly superior in number, and that the President of the United States be requested to cause a gold medal to be struck, emblematical of this triumph, and presented to Major General Macomb.Macomb County, Michigan is named after him.Macomb, Illinois is named after him.[edit] ReferencesArmy Corps of Engineers, Office of HistoryBiographyMacomb FamilyPreceded byJacob J.

S.012 Monument imageMonumentMonuments and Sculptures in DetroitCatalog RecordMonuments and Statues Exhibit PageHomeSearchRecord 12/116Copyright 2001, 2003 Detroit Historical Museum and the Detroit Historical Society.Description: General Alexander Macomb is portrayed in military attire with cape slightly off center, furling in the wind. Perhaps expressing the storm of battle, extreme concentration on his face is enhanced by the triangular shadow cast by his hat.  The granite base sits atop a lower base that is a much broader three-stepped circular base, flanked by three cannons on low pedestals behind and to either side.  The bronze was given a green finish.  On the front of the statue are two raised wreaths and the following: "[incised:] A.A. Weinman. Fecit. [incised:] Cast by/ the Henry-Bonnard Bronze Co./ Mt. Vernon N.Y. 1908. [on front of upper base, incised:] Macomb. [on back of upper base, incised:] To Major General/ Alexander Macomb/ commanding the/ army of the United/ States, hero of the/ Battle of Plattsburg/ This monument is/ erected in the City/ of his birth by the/ Michigan Society/ of the United States/ Daughters of 1812/ September 11, 1908."The idea to erect a Macomb Monument was born on December 13, 1898. It was suggested for Cadillac Square.  Efforts were instigated in 1905 by the National Society of United States Daughters of 1812, State of Michigan, whose purpose was to "carry on patriotic and historical enterprises and to further educational and benevolent undertakings." The project started under the leadership of one president, Mrs. Alfred Russell, and continued with the zeal of the next president, Mrs. Bertram Whitney (who later became Mrs. Thomas Massey of New York.)  The competition for the commission was announced January 14, 1906, in the DETROIT FREE PRESS with a February 1 deadline for sketches. The judges were Charles F. McKim, Daniel H. Burnham, and Augustus Saint-Gaudens. Some of the competitors included Edward Wagner and Carlo Ramanelli of Detroit, and Mrs. John Glenny, whose mother, Mrs. Alfred Russell, was the founder of the Society of Daughters of 1812 in Michigan.  Each artist's model was marked with a symbol instead of theartist's name in order to insure complete fairness.  Adolph Alexander Weinman's design was chosen, with Albert Randolf Ross as architect,  Henry-Bonnard Bronze Company, founder, and Maine & New Hampshire Granite Company as contractor.  In May, 1906, the model was displayed in the Art Museum.  The statue was unveiled and dedicated September 11, 1908.  Weinman's sculpture has received praise and acclaim from the art world.The State of Michigan provided $5,000 funding and the city of Detroit provided $2,000.  The United States donated cannons to be used for metal, and the remaining $5,000 was funded by the Daughters of 1812.  Macomb County desired to own the sculpture from 1972-75, but finally gave up their efforts and decided to erect their own monument.  Lighting for the statue was installed as part of Central District Business Foundation Project in the fall of 1986.General Macomb was born in Detroit on April 3, 1782 the son of a prominent and wealthy fur merchant, who owned much land, and his wife Catharine Navarre.  He moved to New York at age eight, joined the army at 16, and in 1803, become a First Lieutenant.  In 1805, he was promoted to captain.  He was the first graduate of West Point Military Academy.  In 1814, he became Brigadier General, and on September 11, 1814, he distinguished himself at the battle of Plattsburg on Lake Champlaign, New York.  After the war of 1812, he returned to Detroit as Commander of the Fifth Military Department.  Macomb became General in Chief of the American Army in Washington, D.C.  He died on June 25, 1842.More information can be obtained from the Burton Historical Section, located in the Main Branch of the Detroit Public Library.

Perhaps expressing the storm of battle, extreme concentration on his face is enhanced by the triangular shadow cast by his hat.  The granite base sits atop a lower base that is a much broader three-stepped circular base, flanked by three cannons on low pedestals behind and to either side.  The bronze was given a green finish.  On the front of the statue are two raised wreaths and the following: "[incised:] A.A. Weinman. Fecit. [incised:] Cast by/ the Henry-Bonnard Bronze Co./ Mt. Vernon N.Y. 1908. [on front of upper base, incised:] Macomb. [on back of upper base, incised:] To Major General/ Alexander Macomb/ commanding the/ army of the United/ States, hero of the/ Battle of Plattsburg/ This monument is/ erected in the City/ of his birth by the/ Michigan Society/ of the United States/ Daughters of 1812/ September 11, 1908."The idea to erect a Macomb Monument was born on December 13, 1898. It was suggested for Cadillac Square.  Efforts were instigated in 1905 by the National Society of United States Daughters of 1812, State of Michigan, whose purpose was to "carry on patriotic and historical enterprises and to further educational and benevolent undertakings." The project started under the leadership of one president, Mrs. Alfred Russell, and continued with the zeal of the next president, Mrs. Bertram Whitney (who later became Mrs. Thomas Massey of New York.)  The competition for the commission was announced January 14, 1906, in the DETROIT FREE PRESS with a February 1 deadline for sketches. The judges were Charles F. McKim, Daniel H. Burnham, and Augustus Saint-Gaudens. Some of the competitors included Edward Wagner and Carlo Ramanelli of Detroit, and Mrs. John Glenny, whose mother, Mrs. Alfred Russell, was the founder of the Society of Daughters of 1812 in Michigan.

Funds for the printing of two issues having become available, we devote the first to the story of General Alexander Macomb.Sources of Information: A Memoir of Alexander Macomb, the Major Commanding the Army of the United States (New York, 1833), by George H. Richards, constitutes a eulogistic, but useful, biography of General Macomb.  The Macomb Family Record (Camden, N. J., 1917), compiled by Henry A. Macomb, supplies the general history of the family.  For the Detroit background of the Macombs, resort has been had to Father Denissen's Detroit genealogies (ms. in Burton Historical Collection), and to various other sources, both printed and manuscript.  The story of the Plattsburg campaign is perhaps best told in Henry Adams, History of the United States of America during  the Second Administration of James Madison (New York, 1891), VII.Detroit Biographies: Alexander MacombBy M. M. QUAIFEA few weeks ago the streets of Detroit swarmed with soldiers. From far and wide, over 100,000 members of the American Legion had assembled for their annual convention, and the city resounded to the tramp of marching feet and the blare of bands and bugles, while the eyes of the onlookers were dazzled with the colorful spectacle which the uncounted banners and the variegated regalia of the marchers combined to present.The particular playground of the myriad revelers was Washington Boulevard, at whose southern end the martial figure, booted and cloaked, of General Alexander Macomb gazes down upon the thronging traffic of Michigan Avenue.  So curiously evanescent is mundane fame, that it may well be doubted whether one in a hundred of the revelers knew, or troubled to read, the identity of the soldier whose memory the monument honors. To record the story of his career and ancestry for the benefit of his fellow townsmen of a later generation is the task of our present narrative.The paternal forebears of General Macomb were Scots, who, toward the close of the seventeenth century, migrated to Ireland and there found a new home in County Antrim.  Here John Gordon Macomb, grandfather of the future General, and first of the line to migrate to America, was born in 1717.  Toward the middle of the century he married Jane Gordon. Several years later (about 1755), he removed from the Old World to the New, settling in Albany, N. Y. The terrible Seven Years' War was then about to open, and this development may have been responsible for Macomb's migration, for he was a merchant, associated in business with a kinsman, General James Gordon, who was interested in the fur trade and in contracts for furnishing supplies to the army in America.  Albany had been, since its founding about a century and a half before, an outstanding center of Dutch and English fur-trade activities; and following the conquest of Canada which the war now opening was to witness, its importance as a center of operations connected with the Indian trade was augmented.How long John Gordon Macomb continued to reside in Albany we are unable to determine.  Various letters formerly preserved among the Sir William Johnson Papers disclose that about the end of the year 1764 he became financially embarrassed, and made an assignment of his property to a group of Albany and Sche-4BURTON HISTORICAL COLLECTION LEAFLET.4nectady merchants who may be presumed to have been his principal creditors.  One of these was John Duncan, formerly an army officer, who, upon the conquest of Canada in lr60, began trading operations on a large scale with Niagara, Detroit, and the other western posts. Under the circumstances of the case, it is distinctly to Macomb's credit that Duncan, even while reporting his business failure to Sir William, testifies to his good character, while James Phyn, another Schenectady merchant, about the same time comments, with evident pity, upon "poore" Macomb's affairs.1If family tradition be valid, about the year 1770 Macomb removed to Detroit, where he died about the close of the century.  The total silence of contemporary local records concerning him, however, induces the question whether he was ever a resident of Detroit.  At the time of his supposed removal he was but little past fifty years of age, and it would seem probable that he must have engaged in some business activity.   No record of such activity has been found, however, nor is his name entered in the detailed censuses of Detroit of 1779 and 1782.  Apparently he was not the head of a household at these dates, and the probable alternative is that if a resident of Detroit at all he was an inmate of the home of one of his sons.To these sons, Alexander, born, July 27, 1748, and William, born, November 14, 1751, the reader may now be introduced.  Both were born in Ireland at the parental seat of Dunturky, which lies in County Antrim, a few miles north of Belfast.  Both spent the years of their youth in Albany and were in the dawn of their early manhood when they came to Detroit.  The misfortune which had attended their father in the old home was quickly reversed by them in the new one.  They engaged in business and despite their youth and want of experience throve so amazingly that by the opening of the Revolution they were numbered among the leading merchants of Detroit.  The war that began on the seaboard in 1775 worked to their individual advantage, for Detroit was the center of British governmental authority and military activity in the West, and enormous sums of money were soon being spent upon activities incidental to the prosecution of the war.  Alexander and William Macomb became the fiscal agents of the government in Detroit, and from this employment and their private business enormous profits were reaped.  By the close of the war, when they were still in their early thirties, no one stood higher than they in the official and commercial life of Detroit.  In the Burton Historical Collection are five large books of record of the firm of Macomb, Edgar and Macomb (William Edgar was admitted as a partner during the war, and before its close had1See Calendar of the Sir William Johnson Papers (Albany, 1909), inedex entries.5ALEXANDER MACOMB.5amassed a comfortable fortune), whose contents disclose many interesting, and frequently quaint, pictures of the life of Revolutionary Detroit.  For example, we learn that Justice Philip Dejean, Detroit's notorious hanging magistrate, "rented" a stove at one time; or we follow the articles of daily food and apparel of many a famous "father" of Detroit; or, again, we may learn the names and the daily wage of the Detroit citizens who in 1780 marched under Captain Henry Bird against the settlements of infant Kentucky, and returned to Detroit conveying several hundred despairing, woebegone captives.The prosperity which attended the business career of Alexander and William Macomb found reflection, of course, in their social and other activities.  Their trade, for government purposes alone, says Mr. Burton, exceeded, in some years, half a million dollars. "They were Indian traders, general merchants, real estate dealers, and bankers, and probably carried on many more pursuits that were required in the village."2  Among other activities, they became large holders of real estate.  They obtained Grosse Ile from the Indians in July, 1776; and William, many years later, became the owner of Belle Isle.  He also purchased the St. Martin farm with its mansion, which became his home until his death in 1796.  Unlike Alexander (in the career of whose famous son we are chiefly interested), who removed to New York City at the close of the war, William continued a resident and foremost citizen of Detroit to the end of his life.   Illustrative of his status in British Detroit is the fact of his election in 1792 to the Provincial Parliament of Upper Canada, in the first popular electoral contest ever held in Detroit.  Belle Isle, Grosse Ile , and the St. Martin farm (better known today as the Cass farm) were all included in the extensive estate which, at death, he left to his heirs.  To the present moment his descendants have been numerously represented on Grosse Ile and in Detroit, and before returning to the narrative of Alexander's career and family, we may summarize briefly the story of William's descendants.On July 18, 1780, he married Jane Dring, a woman of French Huguenot antecedents.  They had eleven children, three of whom died in early childhood, two of them victims of the distressing epidemic which afflicted Detroit in the autumn of 1785. Three sons and five daughters grew up, married, and in their turn reared families. With astonishing regularity these descendants of William Macomb followed military careers, or (if women) became the wives and mothers of soldiers.  In our limited sketch, only a few of the more noteworthy among them can be noticed.  William Macomb II married Monique Navarre and lived on Grosse Ile.  She perished untimely in 1813 from exposure and fright resulting from an Indian2Michigan Pioneer Collections. XXXV. 5686BURTON HISTORICAL COLLECTION LEAFLET.6raid upon the island.  Three years later he married Mary Jane Godet (dit Marantette  dit Francheville, of  Sandwich.   Tragedy again overtook him when in 1826 he was killed by one of his farm animals.  David B., youngest son of William Macomb, in 1816, married Mary, daughter of Governor Thomas Worthington of Ohio.  One of their sons (a grandson of William Macomb) became a rear admiral in the U. S. navy. Of the daughters of William Macomb, Anne, the eldest, who grew to maturity, married Captain Aeneas Mackay, who as a young lieutenant commanded the military escort which accompanied Governor Lewis Cass on his notable expedition to Lake Superior and the upper Mississippi in 1820.  He spent his life in the army, and for meritorious service in the Mexican War was brevetted colonel.  Catherine Macomb, next in age to Anne, married her cousin, General Alexander Macomb, and her story will be told with that of her famous husband.  Sarah, another sister, married John A. Rucker of New York City.  He served in the War of 1812, and two or three years after its close came to reside on Grosse Ile , where he died in 1845.  One of their sons, Daniel A. Rucker, spent his life in the army, in which he became a major general and quartermaster general of the Union army in the Civil War.  He was twice married, the second time to Irene Curtis, herself the granddaughter, daughter, wife, and mother of soldiers.  Her maternal grandfather was Captain John Whistler, builder and long the commandant of Fort Dearborn in Chicago.  Her father was Captain Daniel Curtis of the regular army; and Irene Rucker, one of her daughters, became the wife of General Philip Sheridan of Civil War fame, later commander-in-chief of the U. S. army.  Eliza, William Macomb's youngest daughter, likewise followed the family custom of marrying into the army, her husband being Captain Henry Whiting of the First Artillery.  For gallant service in the battle of Buena Vista he was brevetted a brigadier general.  One of their sons spent his life in the navy, entering as a midshipman in 1841 and retiring forty years later with the rank of commodore.The summary here set forth suffices to suggest, although it is far from exhausting, the story of the contribution made by William Macomb's descendants to the cause of their country.  From it we return to Alexander, the elder brother.  On May 4, 1773, Major Henry Bassett, commandant of Detroit, performed the marriage ceremony which united the rising young merchant with Catherine Navarre. The bride, just past her sixteenth birthday, was a daughter of Robert Navarre the elder, who had come to Detroit in 1729, and to the end of the French regime had served as sub-intendant and royal notary of Fort Pontchartrain du Detroit.  Next to the commandant, Navarre was perhaps the most influential man in French7ALEXANDER MACOMB.7Detroit.  With the British conquest he lost his status as subintendant, but so useful was his service to the conquerors that he was continued in the office of notary. For thirty years prior to his death in 1791, he resided on his farm west of the fort, which in recent decades has become known as the Woodbridge farm.  The mother of the future commander of the United States army represented the best lineage and culture of French Detroit.  Before her death, which occurred in New York City, November 17, 1789, ten children had blessed her union with her husband. Alexander Macomb remarried two years later, his second wife being Mrs. Jane Rucker, widow of a New York City merchant of German origin, who had died in 1788, and the mother of John Anthony Rucker, who in 1809, as we have seen, married Sarah, William Macomb's daughter.  From the union of Alexander Macomb with Jane Rucker, seven children were born, making seventeen in all who claimed Alexander Macomb as their father.We have already observed that at the close of the Revolution he removed from Detroit to New York City.  The cause of this migration is a matter of uncertainty.  No man in Detroit had prospered more abundantly, and none, seemingly, possessed greater assurance of continued influence and pro[s]perity than Alexander Macomb.  Yet the close of the war marks a turning point in Detroit's commercial fortunes.  For forty years following 1780 the city marked time, with no increase in population and with little, or none, in commercial importance.  The period was marked, too, by governmental changes and uncertainties, and by a revolution in the economic outlook which spelled the ruin of many Detroit business men.  Did Alexander Macomb, wiser than his fellow citizens, sense in advance this period of trial and stagnation, and forehandedly remove himself from the scene; or did he, rather, like Alexander of old, sigh for new worlds to conquer?  Whatever his reason for the migration, in his new home he prospered greatly for a time, quickly becoming one of the foremost merchants of New York City.  On Broadway, between Trinity Church and the Battery, he built a family mansion which a few years later became the residence of the first President of the United States.  He embarked upon huge ventures in real estate, buying in a single transaction over three and a half million acres of land, comprising several present-day New York counties.  Disaster overtook him ere long, however, as it had overtaken his father thirty years earlier, and Macomb exchanged his proud position as one of the foremost capitalists of the land for that of an inmate of the debtor's prison in New York.  He died in Georgetown, D. C. in January, 1831, having made his home in his later years with his distinguished son and namesake, General Alexander Macomb.8BURTON HISTORICAL COLLECTION LEAFLET.8The seven children of Alexander Macomb's second marriage, who were all born in New York, and were, of course, half-brothers and half-sisters of the General, require but brief notice.   Three were sons, all of whom died unmarried.  The eldest, Henry Hamilton Macomb, named for Detroit's Revolutionary governor, practiced law in New York City and served as a soldier in the War of 1812.  Charles, the second son, became a lieutenant in the artillery, served in the war, and in 1816, at the early age of twenty-two, was killed in a duel with a fellow officer.  Three of the four daughters married, and the husbands of two of the three were lawyers and judges.We return, at length, to the ten children of Alexander Macomb and Catherine Navarre, all but the last two of whom were born in Detroit.  The first of these was John Navarre, born "within the fortification" of Detroit, March 7, 1774, who was evidently named to honor his two grandfathers.  He was a boy of eleven when the family removed to New York.  There he entered upon a mercantile career, and in 1797 married Christina Livingston, a member of the notable Livingston family of New York.  In 1810, while on a voyage to Europe, the vessel on which he sailed was attacked by a French privateer and Macomb, volunteering to assist in its defense, was numbered among the slain.Jane Macomb was born in Detroit, also "within the fortification," August 21, 1776. In 1792 she married Robert Kennedy, whose father was Earl of Cassilis and an admiral in the British navy. The Kennedy family lived at Number 1 Broadway, at this time, while the Macomb home was at Number 7 Broadway. Robert Kennedy later removed with his wife to England, where he died in 1843. His wife died in London in 1867, in her ninety-first year.  Passing Mary Catherine and William (born in 1777 and 1779), who died unmarried, we come to Sarah, who was born February 2, 1781, and baptized by Colonel De Peyster, commandant of Detroit.  She subsequently married in New York the Colonel's nephew and namesake, Captain Arent Schuyler De Peyster, who spent his life as a sailor and discoverer.  He is said to have doubled the Cape of Good Hope fifteen times in the course of his long career at sea, and on one of his numerous voyages he discovered the islands in the South Pacific which today bear his name.Alexander, the seventh child of Alexander Macomb Sr. and Catherine Navarre, was born in the old St. Martin home adjoining the stockaded inclosure of the fort, April 3, 1782.  A more appropriate setting for the birth of a future military hero could scarcely be imagined.  The house itself, of massive construction, bore many scars inflicted by tomahawk and gunshot, memorials of the terrible siege of 1763.   It had recently become the property of William9ALEXANDER MACOMB.9Macomb, brother and partner of Alexander's father; and as one direct result of the War of 1813, it was destined to become for many years the home of Lewis Cass and the virtual capitol of Michigan Territory.3  For the painted and bedecked warriors who swarmed to Detroit throughout the Revolution, the Macomb place afforded a convenient camping ground, while within easy sight and sound the red-coated sentries of King George paced their monotonous rounds and over the town and rippling water daily reechoed the booming of the sunrise and sunset gun.In such an atmosphere of martial pomp and circumstance were the formative years of General Macomb's infancy passed.  At the age of eight years, following the parental removal to New York, he became a pupil at the academy in Newark, where, still a mere child, he observed and to some extent shared in the partisan rivalries over the merits of the French Revolutionary movement, which then agitated the minds of all Americans.  Possibly a more important factor in the boy's development than his formal schooling resulted from the fostering oversight of his brother-in-law.  In 1795 his elder sister, Jane Macomb, married, as we have seen, Robert Kennedy, son of the Earl of Cassilis.  Possessed of means and social standing, the bridegroom enjoyed on an estate near Newark the life of a country gentleman.  He invited young Macomb to become an inmate of his home, and its atmosphere of refinement and gentility contributed materially to the training of the future soldier.In the spring of 1798 he was elected to membership in a somewhat exclusive company of New York City militia.  This same year the dispute with the French government which brought our country to the commission of acts of war upon France became acute.  Macomb applied for a commission in the army which the government was organizing, and on the recommendation of Alexander Hamilton, who was to be its commander, was appointed a cornet of cavalry. Although the expected war was averted, the young officer, not yet seventeen at the time of his appointment, began his military education under the immediate eye of the commander of the army.  His progress was rapid, and in perusing its details one is impressed with his evident ability to command the friendly attention of men of important official station, which contributed so frequently to his further advancement.  Such a friendship with General James Wilkinson gained him the appointment, in the summer of 1801, of secretary of the commission to treat with the Cherokee, Creeks, and other tribes of the Southwest.  A year was spent in this service.  At its termination, a similar friendship which Macomb had established with Major Jonathan Williams of the Engineers, procured his appointment to3For a comprehensive sketch of the St. Martin-Macomb-Cass house, see "The Mansion of St. Martin," B. H. Coil. Leaflet, III, 33-48.10BURTON HISTORICAL COLLECTION LEAFLET.10a lieutenancy in the Engineer Corps of the army.  He was ordered to West Point, where the now-famous military academy was just beginning to function.  The lieutenants and cadets of the Engineer Corps were regarded as students, and Macomb thus became one of the earliest graduates of the academy.  Upon graduation he was appointed to the duty of adjutant, and in this capacity he first organized and instructed the cadets as a military corps.An event of the autumn of 1805 sheds an interesting light upon the habits of the army in this period.  General Wilkinson had issued an order requiring officers and soldiers of the army to wear their hair close cropped.  Colonel Thomas Butler, like Wilkinson himself, a veteran of the Revolution, who still disported the queue fashionable in Revolutionary days, indignantly refused to obey the new order. For this offense a general court-martial was convened in Fredericktown, Maryland, to try him, and Lieutenant Macomb was summoned from West Point to play the role of judge advocate to the court. Other trials followed that of Colonel Butler, and so well did Macomb perform the duties of judge advocate that the members of the court urged him to compose a treatise on the conduct of courts-martial. This work he carried out a few years later.  At the time of his service as judge advocate he was but twenty years of age.He remained at West Point until June, 1805, when he was promoted to a captaincy and ordered to Portsmouth to superintend certain harbor construction work.  The next year he was ordered to South Carolina, where he was stationed for several years.  The declaration of war upon Great Britain in IS12 found him a lieutenant colonel and chief engineer for the southern states.  As on other occasions, so on this, the American government blundered into war with a great military power ludicrously unprepared to conduct military operations. Belatedly and futilely an effort was made to develop an army to prosecute the war already at hand, and Macomb was summoned to Washington by the Secretary of War to assume the post of adjutant general of the army.  Although his duties were important, he was unwilling in time of war to remain aloof from the field of action.  Staff officers were not eligible, under the regulations then in force, to exercise active command, and Macomb secured his transfer to the artillery with the rank of colonel.  Repairing to New York, he proceeded to enlist and discipline the regiment to which he had been assigned. Toward the close of the year he marched it  to  Sackett's  Harbor  to  participate  in  an  attack  upon  Kingston; winter was at hand, however, and the projected attack was not carried out, and nothing of consequence could be undertaken until the following season.The conduct of the War of 1812 by our government was so11ALEXANDER MACOMB.11shamefully inefficient that no American can today read the story without being stirred to a sense of anger and disgust over the role our country was made to play.  Only occasionally is the dreary story of official ineptitude and general incompetence relieved by some story of individual achievement. To Macomb, who was a capable and zealous professional soldier, was accorded the opportunity to reap the glory of one of the most cheering interludes in the general tale of disaster which the war afforded to America.His opportunity came with the closing weeks of the war, in the autumn of 1814.  Until then, he had continued to serve creditably but inconspicuously on the Champlain-Ontario frontier, while older officers of higher rank monopolized the public eye and demonstrated repeatedly their incapacity to command an army.  Far from conquering Canada, the American dream at the beginning of the war, the United States was itself being invaded at points as widely separated as Louisiana, Virginia, and Maine; and British officialdom was seriously contemplating the permanent cession of northern New England to Canada, and the erection of the region northwest of the Ohio River as a permanent Indian preserve, from which American civilization should forever be excluded, as a condition to making peace with the United States.Such was the general aspect of affairs when, in August, 1814, Sir George Prevost led the strongest army Great Britain had ever sent to America southward from Montreal toward Lake Champlain. Eleven thousand of Wellesley's veterans, fresh from their triumphs over Napoleon in the Peninsular campaigns, comprised the bulk of the invading army.  Cooperating with it was a small naval force under Captain Downie, whose particular mission it was to destroy the little American fleet on Lake Champlain commanded by Commodore Thomas Macdonough.  The two naval forces were more or less evenly matched, and no one could reasonably foretell the issue of a conflict between them.   On land, the Americans opposed some five or six thousand regular troops under the command of General George lzard to the eleven thousand veterans led by Prevost.  But with a capacity for blundering which at times approached the character of genius, the Secretary of War on the very eve of the invasion ordered General lzard to conduct most of the army to a distant field of action.   Thus it came about that at the very moment when the Americans should have been hurrying every possible reinforcement to Lake Champlain to oppose Prevost's invading host, General lzard marched away toward distant Niagara with practically the entire army already on the ground.Left behind to defend the American position at Plattsburg was General Macomb with a "miscellaneous" force of 3,500 men.  The12BURTON HISTORICAL COLLECTION LEAFLET.12flower of the army had marched with lzard, and the men remaining at Plattsburg have not inaptly been characterized as its "culls." Macomb himself reports that his effective force did not exceed 1,500 in number.  To dispute with such a force the advance of Prevost's magnificent army was a project partaking of madness.  Yet far from abandoning the field, as he might with entire reason have done, Macomb marshalled [marshaled] his pitiful resources, and with unwearied energy and consummate skill prepared to give battle to the enemy.Prevost's advance was delayed for some days awaiting the appearance of Downie, whose fleet was to destroy Macdonough's flotilla while Prevost disposed of Macomb. Early in September, the invasion was begun in earnest.  Macomb sent out several detachments of riflemen and light troops with instructions to harass the advancing British columns, and by every possible means delay and oppose their progress.  So little attention did the veteran regiments pay to this opposition, however, that they did not once bother to deploy in line of battle, pressing steadily on in solid columns.  By September 6, they were opposite the American works, and the time until the eleventh was passed in making preparations for the assault, and awaiting the appearance of Downie.The battle of Plattsburg, fought on September II, was a combined land and naval action.  Macdonough had stationed his fleet in a position where Downie was compelled to attack under conditions favorable to the Americans.  The sequel of a furious battle of several hours' duration was the complete defeat of the invaders. Meanwhile Prevost's storming columns moved forward to their appointed task.  One column, led by General Robinson, moved by a circuitous route to attack the Americans in the rear, while others, assigned to storm the works in front, awaited, in readiness, for the sound of Robinson's attack, which was to be the signal for launching their own assault.  In preparation for such a contingency, Macomb had by night planted all the roads leading to his works with evergreens, and had the roadways strewn with fallen leaves so as to conceal all appearance of a pathway.  Not content with this, he had constructed other roads, all opening into an old way, which led, not to the works, but to Salmon River, and' on this he had posted his militia and a field piece to harass the enemy when he should appear.The intended consequence followed. The attacking columns lost their way, and the actual assault was delayed until the cheers of the Americans apprised the British of the disaster that had overtaken their fleet.  This development induced Prevost to abandon the invasion and return to Canada.  The attack upon the forts was not pressed, and the losses suffered on either side were but trifling.  To13ALEXANDER MACOMB.13the astonishment of the Americans, while they were still nerved to meet the expected assault, some British deserters came in with the word that General Prevost was retreating from his position.  So incredible was this report that it was not believed at once; but on the following morning full confirmation was seen in the abandoned baggage-wagons and other equipage which alone covered the field where a few hours earlier the great army had lain.The battle of Plattsburg, it will be seen, was chiefly fought on the water.   In describing it, most historians have centered their attention upon the naval battle, and have ascribed to Macdonough principal credit for hurling back the invaders.  That Macdonough performed splendidly his allotted task, is clear. A patriotic Canadian historian has characterized him as "an officer of whom any navy in the world might well be proud."  But the backing of the land force, supplied by Macomb, made his victory possible; and although the abandonment of the campaign by General Prevost denied to Macomb the glory of conducting a desperate defense, it is clear that his own skill and unremitting exertion in preparing for the defense was in large measure responsible for the denial.  Macdonough and Macomb were both young officers, (Macdonough was thirty-one, Macomb thirty-two, years of age) and both were a credit to the American nation.  At Plattsburg both reached the high-water-mark of their careers.  In their joint victory there was glory enough for both, and a grateful country bestowed fame in ample measure upon them. Macdonough's victory was essential to the American defense; it is equally clear that Macomb's resolute and skillful generalship made possible Macdonough's triumph.But for Prevost's humiliation at Plattsburg, the British would have ended the war triumphant on every front save that adjacent to Lake Erie, where Commodore Perry's victory of September 10, 1813, had given the Americans the ascendancy.4  They were prepared to demand, and the American government would have been compelled to yield, terms of peace which would have altered radically the entire course of future development of the nation.  Plattsburg ruined this agreeable prospect, and enabled the American negotiators of the Treaty of Ghent to obtain peace on the basis of a return to the status existing prior to the commencement of the war.  Instead of a forced and humiliating concession of the territory won by the War of the Revolution, the United States came out of the war with boundaries intact.  For this we are indebted to the victory of Plattsburg, and chiefly to the splendid leadership of the youthful commanders, Macomb and Macdonough.4The statement made ignores Jackson's victory at New Orleans, which came after the treaty of peace had been signed, and had no influence upon its negotiation.14BURTON HISTORICAL COLLECTION LEAFLET.14The war ended on Christmas Eve, 1814, although several weeks were to pass before the fact became known in America.5  The return of peace entailed a reduction of the army, whose peace-time establishment was fixed at 10,000 men with two major generals and four brigadiers.  Macomb was retained in the service with the rank of senior brigadier general, assigned to command the Third Military Department with headquarters in New York.  Before long he was transferred to the Fifth Department with headquarters in Detroit.Thus it came to pass that he returned to the city of his birth, there to reside from 1816 until 1831.  The unsettled conditions prevailing throughout the Northwest in this period rendered Macomb's station of commanding general one of great importance and difficulty. Under his direction posts were established at Mackinac, Green Bay, Chicago, St. Paul, Prairie du Chien, and Sault Ste. Marie.  Their history is intimately interwoven with the early annals of their respective regions.   Most important of all the northwestern posts, of course, was Detroit, where Macomb exercised control in person. Discord between the army and civilians was a normal feature of life on 'the frontier.  Macomb, however, possessed a rare faculty of getting on with the public, and the years of his administration in Detroit were wholly free from civilian discord.  On the eve of his removal to another station, in the spring of 1821, the townsmen united to present him a silver tankard as a testimonial of their esteem.  The somewhat stilted address composed by Judge Augustus B. Woodward to accompany the presentation affirmed that no official and no citizen of Detroit had ever found occasion for complaint against the General's administration.  For one whose entire career had been spent in the regular army, and who now for half a dozen years had commanded a garrison in the midst of a busy civilian community, this was a significant tribute.The occasion of Macomb's removal from Detroit was the general curtailment of the army which was effected in 1821.  Reduced to the rank of colonel, he was returned to his old employment as chief of the engineer department of the army with headquarters in Washington.  Here he continued to serve until the death of General Jacob Brown, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, in February, 1828. Strange as it may seem, since the War of 1812 the government had neglected to prescribe the order of succession to the position of commander-in-chief; on the death of General Brown, therefore, the rival claims of several officers to the succession were ardently advanced by their friends, and it was even gravely affirmed that one need not even belong to the army to be eligible for the appointment.5The Treaty reached Washington, February 14.  It was not known at Detroit until about the beginning of March.15ALEXANDER MACOMB.15The President solved the problem by the appointment of Macomb, who in May, 1828, became a major general and commander-in-chief of the army.The boy who was born in a foreign land (Detroit was under the rule of Great Britain until 1796)  had now achieved the highest station his chosen profession opened to him.  For his conduct at Plattsburg he had received the warmest expressions of appreciation of the national government, of the States-of New York and Virginia, and of the City of New York.  His administration of the army lasted thirteen years, from 1828 until his death in 1841.  Indian wars aside, it was an era of peace for the nation, and no opportunity to win spectacular distinction was afforded Macomb in this period. From the point of view of his military glory this was a great misfortune ; had Macomb lived a few years longer, there is every reason to suppose that the fame achieved by Taylor and Scott in the Mexican War would have been garnered, instead, by him. As it was, he played well his part throughout his entire career, winning the steadfast approval alike of his associates in the army, his civilian superiors in public life, and of the masses of his countrymen.   More solid achievement than this could scarcely be anticipated, or desired.To complete his story it remains to speak of his private life. In July, 1803, he married his cousin, Catherine Macomb, who was born in Detroit, October 30, 1787, and was now a maiden of almost sixteen summers.  Apparently it was an ideal union.  To be with her husband in his numerous changes of station, Mrs. Macomb "encountered the perils of climate in the North and in the South, and of travel by land, and sea, and lake.  She dared the hazards of war, in camp and garrison; and found a shield from all dangers and sorrows in her husband's arms."  Before her death in 1822 she had become the mother of twelve children.6Three of these died in early childhood, and two in early maturity.  Both the remaining sons  followed military careers, and most of the five remaining daughters married into the army or navy. Alexander Saranac, born June 3, 1814, entered West Point in 1830, was graduated, and attained the rank of major before resigning his commission in 1841.  In 1840 he married Susan Kearny of New York, sister of General Philip Kearny of Mexican and Civil War fame.  William Henry, the remaining son, who was born in Detroit in 1819, entered the U. S. navy as a midshipman in 1834 and died with the rank of commodore in 1872.  He married a daughter of General Henry Stanton, whose second wife was his elder sister, Alexandrine Macomb.6On May 26, 1826, General Macomb married Mrs. Harriet Balch Wilson of Georgetown.  No children were born of this union, and nothing has been learned by the present writer concerning Mrs. Wilson's career.16BURTON HISTORICAL COLLECTION LEAFLET.16Catherine, eldest daughter of General Alexander Macomb, in 1821 married John Mason Jr. of Virginia, son of the author of the famous Bill of Rights, and himself secretary of the U. S. legation to Mexico.   Alexandrine, born in 1808, in 1834 married Henry Stanton, colonel and brevet brigadier general in the army.  He died in 1856 at Fort Hamilton, New York, where he had long been stationed, and where all of their seven children were born.  Czarina, born in 1810, married her- cousin, John Navarre Macomb of New York, who spent his life in the army, and retired with the rank of colonel in 1883.  Mrs. Macomb died in 1846 and the widower later married a daughter of Commodore John Rodgers of the U. S. navy. A son of this union was Montgomery Meigs Macomb, who retired from the army in 1917 with the rank of brigadier general.  Sarah Macomb, who was born in Detroit in March, 1831, only a few weeks before her father's removal from this place, married Henry Whiting Stanton, son of General Henry Stanton, who likewise was a native of Detroit.  He was graduated from West Point in 1842, attained the rank of captain, and was slain in a fight with the Apache in 1855.7  The widow subsequently married John Charles Devereux Williams, son of John R. Williams of Detroit.  The last of General Macomb's daughters, for whom her mother's life was given, was Jane Octavia, born in Georgetown, September 17, 1883. True to the family tradition, she married in 1841, Morris S, Miller, a graduate of West Point in 1831 and a lieutenant in the army, who attained the rank of brevet brigadier general in the Civil War.7Fort Stanton, New Mexico, was named in his memory.Marshall Davies Lloyd#*#HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"#*#Burton Leaflet: Alexander MacombQuaife, M[ilo].

Funds for the printing of two issues having become available, we devote the first to the story of General Alexander Macomb.Sources of Information: A Memoir of Alexander Macomb, the Major Commanding the Army of the United States (New York, 1833), by George H. Richards, constitutes a eulogistic, but useful, biography of General Macomb.  The Macomb Family Record (Camden, N. J., 1917), compiled by Henry A. Macomb, supplies the general history of the family.  For the Detroit background of the Macombs, resort has been had to Father Denissen's Detroit genealogies (ms. in Burton Historical Collection), and to various other sources, both printed and manuscript.  The story of the Plattsburg campaign is perhaps best told in Henry Adams, History of the United States of America during  the Second Administration of James Madison (New York, 1891), VII.Detroit Biographies: Alexander MacombBy M. M. QUAIFEA few weeks ago the streets of Detroit swarmed with soldiers. From far and wide, over 100,000 members of the American Legion had assembled for their annual convention, and the city resounded to the tramp of marching feet and the blare of bands and bugles, while the eyes of the onlookers were dazzled with the colorful spectacle which the uncounted banners and the variegated regalia of the marchers combined to present.The particular playground of the myriad revelers was Washington Boulevard, at whose southern end the martial figure, booted and cloaked, of General Alexander Macomb gazes down upon the thronging traffic of Michigan Avenue.  So curiously evanescent is mundane fame, that it may well be doubted whether one in a hundred of the revelers knew, or troubled to read, the identity of the soldier whose memory the monument honors. To record the story of his career and ancestry for the benefit of his fellow townsmen of a later generation is the task of our present narrative.The paternal forebears of General Macomb were Scots, who, toward the close of the seventeenth century, migrated to Ireland and there found a new home in County Antrim.  Here John Gordon Macomb, grandfather of the future General, and first of the line to migrate to America, was born in 1717.  Toward the middle of the century he married Jane Gordon. Several years later (about 1755), he removed from the Old World to the New, settling in Albany, N. Y. The terrible Seven Years' War was then about to open, and this development may have been responsible for Macomb's migration, for he was a merchant, associated in business with a kinsman, General James Gordon, who was interested in the fur trade and in contracts for furnishing supplies to the army in America.  Albany had been, since its founding about a century and a half before, an outstanding center of Dutch and English fur-trade activities; and following the conquest of Canada which the war now opening was to witness, its importance as a center of operations connected with the Indian trade was augmented.How long John Gordon Macomb continued to reside in Albany we are unable to determine.  Various letters formerly preserved among the Sir William Johnson Papers disclose that about the end of the year 1764 he became financially embarrassed, and made an assignment of his property to a group of Albany and Sche-4BURTON HISTORICAL COLLECTION LEAFLET.4nectady merchants who may be presumed to have been his principal creditors.  One of these was John Duncan, formerly an army officer, who, upon the conquest of Canada in lr60, began trading operations on a large scale with Niagara, Detroit, and the other western posts. Under the circumstances of the case, it is distinctly to Macomb's credit that Duncan, even while reporting his business failure to Sir William, testifies to his good character, while James Phyn, another Schenectady merchant, about the same time comments, with evident pity, upon "poore" Macomb's affairs.1If family tradition be valid, about the year 1770 Macomb removed to Detroit, where he died about the close of the century.  The total silence of contemporary local records concerning him, however, induces the question whether he was ever a resident of Detroit.  At the time of his supposed removal he was but little past fifty years of age, and it would seem probable that he must have engaged in some business activity.   No record of such activity has been found, however, nor is his name entered in the detailed censuses of Detroit of 1779 and 1782.  Apparently he was not the head of a household at these dates, and the probable alternative is that if a resident of Detroit at all he was an inmate of the home of one of his sons.To these sons, Alexander, born, July 27, 1748, and William, born, November 14, 1751, the reader may now be introduced.  Both were born in Ireland at the parental seat of Dunturky, which lies in County Antrim, a few miles north of Belfast.  Both spent the years of their youth in Albany and were in the dawn of their early manhood when they came to Detroit.  The misfortune which had attended their father in the old home was quickly reversed by them in the new one.  They engaged in business and despite their youth and want of experience throve so amazingly that by the opening of the Revolution they were numbered among the leading merchants of Detroit.  The war that began on the seaboard in 1775 worked to their individual advantage, for Detroit was the center of British governmental authority and military activity in the West, and enormous sums of money were soon being spent upon activities incidental to the prosecution of the war.  Alexander and William Macomb became the fiscal agents of the government in Detroit, and from this employment and their private business enormous profits were reaped.  By the close of the war, when they were still in their early thirties, no one stood higher than they in the official and commercial life of Detroit.  In the Burton Historical Collection are five large books of record of the firm of Macomb, Edgar and Macomb (William Edgar was admitted as a partner during the war, and before its close had1See Calendar of the Sir William Johnson Papers (Albany, 1909), inedex entries.5ALEXANDER MACOMB.5amassed a comfortable fortune), whose contents disclose many interesting, and frequently quaint, pictures of the life of Revolutionary Detroit.  For example, we learn that Justice Philip Dejean, Detroit's notorious hanging magistrate, "rented" a stove at one time; or we follow the articles of daily food and apparel of many a famous "father" of Detroit; or, again, we may learn the names and the daily wage of the Detroit citizens who in 1780 marched under Captain Henry Bird against the settlements of infant Kentucky, and returned to Detroit conveying several hundred despairing, woebegone captives.The prosperity which attended the business career of Alexander and William Macomb found reflection, of course, in their social and other activities.  Their trade, for government purposes alone, says Mr. Burton, exceeded, in some years, half a million dollars. "They were Indian traders, general merchants, real estate dealers, and bankers, and probably carried on many more pursuits that were required in the village."2  Among other activities, they became large holders of real estate.  They obtained Grosse Ile from the Indians in July, 1776; and William, many years later, became the owner of Belle Isle.  He also purchased the St. Martin farm with its mansion, which became his home until his death in 1796.  Unlike Alexander (in the career of whose famous son we are chiefly interested), who removed to New York City at the close of the war, William continued a resident and foremost citizen of Detroit to the end of his life.   Illustrative of his status in British Detroit is the fact of his election in 1792 to the Provincial Parliament of Upper Canada, in the first popular electoral contest ever held in Detroit.  Belle Isle, Grosse Ile , and the St. Martin farm (better known today as the Cass farm) were all included in the extensive estate which, at death, he left to his heirs.  To the present moment his descendants have been numerously represented on Grosse Ile and in Detroit, and before returning to the narrative of Alexander's career and family, we may summarize briefly the story of William's descendants.On July 18, 1780, he married Jane Dring, a woman of French Huguenot antecedents.  They had eleven children, three of whom died in early childhood, two of them victims of the distressing epidemic which afflicted Detroit in the autumn of 1785. Three sons and five daughters grew up, married, and in their turn reared families. With astonishing regularity these descendants of William Macomb followed military careers, or (if women) became the wives and mothers of soldiers.  In our limited sketch, only a few of the more noteworthy among them can be noticed.  William Macomb II married Monique Navarre and lived on Grosse Ile.  She perished untimely in 1813 from exposure and fright resulting from an Indian2Michigan Pioneer Collections. XXXV. 5686BURTON HISTORICAL COLLECTION LEAFLET.6raid upon the island.  Three years later he married Mary Jane Godet (dit Marantette  dit Francheville, of  Sandwich.   Tragedy again overtook him when in 1826 he was killed by one of his farm animals.  David B., youngest son of William Macomb, in 1816, married Mary, daughter of Governor Thomas Worthington of Ohio.  One of their sons (a grandson of William Macomb) became a rear admiral in the U. S. navy. Of the daughters of William Macomb, Anne, the eldest, who grew to maturity, married Captain Aeneas Mackay, who as a young lieutenant commanded the military escort which accompanied Governor Lewis Cass on his notable expedition to Lake Superior and the upper Mississippi in 1820.  He spent his life in the army, and for meritorious service in the Mexican War was brevetted colonel.  Catherine Macomb, next in age to Anne, married her cousin, General Alexander Macomb, and her story will be told with that of her famous husband.  Sarah, another sister, married John A. Rucker of New York City.  He served in the War of 1812, and two or three years after its close came to reside on Grosse Ile , where he died in 1845.  One of their sons, Daniel A. Rucker, spent his life in the army, in which he became a major general and quartermaster general of the Union army in the Civil War.  He was twice married, the second time to Irene Curtis, herself the granddaughter, daughter, wife, and mother of soldiers.  Her maternal grandfather was Captain John Whistler, builder and long the commandant of Fort Dearborn in Chicago.  Her father was Captain Daniel Curtis of the regular army; and Irene Rucker, one of her daughters, became the wife of General Philip Sheridan of Civil War fame, later commander-in-chief of the U. S. army.  Eliza, William Macomb's youngest daughter, likewise followed the family custom of marrying into the army, her husband being Captain Henry Whiting of the First Artillery.  For gallant service in the battle of Buena Vista he was brevetted a brigadier general.  One of their sons spent his life in the navy, entering as a midshipman in 1841 and retiring forty years later with the rank of commodore.The summary here set forth suffices to suggest, although it is far from exhausting, the story of the contribution made by William Macomb's descendants to the cause of their country.  From it we return to Alexander, the elder brother.  On May 4, 1773, Major Henry Bassett, commandant of Detroit, performed the marriage ceremony which united the rising young merchant with Catherine Navarre. The bride, just past her sixteenth birthday, was a daughter of Robert Navarre the elder, who had come to Detroit in 1729, and to the end of the French regime had served as sub-intendant and royal notary of Fort Pontchartrain du Detroit.  Next to the commandant, Navarre was perhaps the most influential man in French7ALEXANDER MACOMB.7Detroit.  With the British conquest he lost his status as subintendant, but so useful was his service to the conquerors that he was continued in the office of notary. For thirty years prior to his death in 1791, he resided on his farm west of the fort, which in recent decades has become known as the Woodbridge farm.  The mother of the future commander of the United States army represented the best lineage and culture of French Detroit.  Before her death, which occurred in New York City, November 17, 1789, ten children had blessed her union with her husband. Alexander Macomb remarried two years later, his second wife being Mrs. Jane Rucker, widow of a New York City merchant of German origin, who had died in 1788, and the mother of John Anthony Rucker, who in 1809, as we have seen, married Sarah, William Macomb's daughter.  From the union of Alexander Macomb with Jane Rucker, seven children were born, making seventeen in all who claimed Alexander Macomb as their father.We have already observed that at the close of the Revolution he removed from Detroit to New York City.  The cause of this migration is a matter of uncertainty.  No man in Detroit had prospered more abundantly, and none, seemingly, possessed greater assurance of continued influence and pro[s]perity than Alexander Macomb.  Yet the close of the war marks a turning point in Detroit's commercial fortunes.  For forty years following 1780 the city marked time, with no increase in population and with little, or none, in commercial importance.  The period was marked, too, by governmental changes and uncertainties, and by a revolution in the economic outlook which spelled the ruin of many Detroit business men.  Did Alexander Macomb, wiser than his fellow citizens, sense in advance this period of trial and stagnation, and forehandedly remove himself from the scene; or did he, rather, like Alexander of old, sigh for new worlds to conquer?  Whatever his reason for the migration, in his new home he prospered greatly for a time, quickly becoming one of the foremost merchants of New York City.  On Broadway, between Trinity Church and the Battery, he built a family mansion which a few years later became the residence of the first President of the United States.  He embarked upon huge ventures in real estate, buying in a single transaction over three and a half million acres of land, comprising several present-day New York counties.  Disaster overtook him ere long, however, as it had overtaken his father thirty years earlier, and Macomb exchanged his proud position as one of the foremost capitalists of the land for that of an inmate of the debtor's prison in New York.  He died in Georgetown, D. C. in January, 1831, having made his home in his later years with his distinguished son and namesake, General Alexander Macomb.8BURTON HISTORICAL COLLECTION LEAFLET.8The seven children of Alexander Macomb's second marriage, who were all born in New York, and were, of course, half-brothers and half-sisters of the General, require but brief notice.   Three were sons, all of whom died unmarried.  The eldest, Henry Hamilton Macomb, named for Detroit's Revolutionary governor, practiced law in New York City and served as a soldier in the War of 1812.  Charles, the second son, became a lieutenant in the artillery, served in the war, and in 1816, at the early age of twenty-two, was killed in a duel with a fellow officer.  Three of the four daughters married, and the husbands of two of the three were lawyers and judges.We return, at length, to the ten children of Alexander Macomb and Catherine Navarre, all but the last two of whom were born in Detroit.  The first of these was John Navarre, born "within the fortification" of Detroit, March 7, 1774, who was evidently named to honor his two grandfathers.  He was a boy of eleven when the family removed to New York.  There he entered upon a mercantile career, and in 1797 married Christina Livingston, a member of the notable Livingston family of New York.  In 1810, while on a voyage to Europe, the vessel on which he sailed was attacked by a French privateer and Macomb, volunteering to assist in its defense, was numbered among the slain.Jane Macomb was born in Detroit, also "within the fortification," August 21, 1776. In 1792 she married Robert Kennedy, whose father was Earl of Cassilis and an admiral in the British navy. The Kennedy family lived at Number 1 Broadway, at this time, while the Macomb home was at Number 7 Broadway. Robert Kennedy later removed with his wife to England, where he died in 1843. His wife died in London in 1867, in her ninety-first year.  Passing Mary Catherine and William (born in 1777 and 1779), who died unmarried, we come to Sarah, who was born February 2, 1781, and baptized by Colonel De Peyster, commandant of Detroit.  She subsequently married in New York the Colonel's nephew and namesake, Captain Arent Schuyler De Peyster, who spent his life as a sailor and discoverer.  He is said to have doubled the Cape of Good Hope fifteen times in the course of his long career at sea, and on one of his numerous voyages he discovered the islands in the South Pacific which today bear his name.Alexander, the seventh child of Alexander Macomb Sr. and Catherine Navarre, was born in the old St. Martin home adjoining the stockaded inclosure of the fort, April 3, 1782.  A more appropriate setting for the birth of a future military hero could scarcely be imagined.  The house itself, of massive construction, bore many scars inflicted by tomahawk and gunshot, memorials of the terrible siege of 1763.   It had recently become the property of William9ALEXANDER MACOMB.9Macomb, brother and partner of Alexander's father; and as one direct result of the War of 1813, it was destined to become for many years the home of Lewis Cass and the virtual capitol of Michigan Territory.3  For the painted and bedecked warriors who swarmed to Detroit throughout the Revolution, the Macomb place afforded a convenient camping ground, while within easy sight and sound the red-coated sentries of King George paced their monotonous rounds and over the town and rippling water daily reechoed the booming of the sunrise and sunset gun.In such an atmosphere of martial pomp and circumstance were the formative years of General Macomb's infancy passed.  At the age of eight years, following the parental removal to New York, he became a pupil at the academy in Newark, where, still a mere child, he observed and to some extent shared in the partisan rivalries over the merits of the French Revolutionary movement, which then agitated the minds of all Americans.  Possibly a more important factor in the boy's development than his formal schooling resulted from the fostering oversight of his brother-in-law.  In 1795 his elder sister, Jane Macomb, married, as we have seen, Robert Kennedy, son of the Earl of Cassilis.  Possessed of means and social standing, the bridegroom enjoyed on an estate near Newark the life of a country gentleman.  He invited young Macomb to become an inmate of his home, and its atmosphere of refinement and gentility contributed materially to the training of the future soldier.In the spring of 1798 he was elected to membership in a somewhat exclusive company of New York City militia.  This same year the dispute with the French government which brought our country to the commission of acts of war upon France became acute.  Macomb applied for a commission in the army which the government was organizing, and on the recommendation of Alexander Hamilton, who was to be its commander, was appointed a cornet of cavalry. Although the expected war was averted, the young officer, not yet seventeen at the time of his appointment, began his military education under the immediate eye of the commander of the army.  His progress was rapid, and in perusing its details one is impressed with his evident ability to command the friendly attention of men of important official station, which contributed so frequently to his further advancement.  Such a friendship with General James Wilkinson gained him the appointment, in the summer of 1801, of secretary of the commission to treat with the Cherokee, Creeks, and other tribes of the Southwest.  A year was spent in this service.  At its termination, a similar friendship which Macomb had established with Major Jonathan Williams of the Engineers, procured his appointment to3For a comprehensive sketch of the St. Martin-Macomb-Cass house, see "The Mansion of St. Martin," B. H. Coil. Leaflet, III, 33-48.10BURTON HISTORICAL COLLECTION LEAFLET.10a lieutenancy in the Engineer Corps of the army.  He was ordered to West Point, where the now-famous military academy was just beginning to function.  The lieutenants and cadets of the Engineer Corps were regarded as students, and Macomb thus became one of the earliest graduates of the academy.  Upon graduation he was appointed to the duty of adjutant, and in this capacity he first organized and instructed the cadets as a military corps.An event of the autumn of 1805 sheds an interesting light upon the habits of the army in this period.  General Wilkinson had issued an order requiring officers and soldiers of the army to wear their hair close cropped.  Colonel Thomas Butler, like Wilkinson himself, a veteran of the Revolution, who still disported the queue fashionable in Revolutionary days, indignantly refused to obey the new order. For this offense a general court-martial was convened in Fredericktown, Maryland, to try him, and Lieutenant Macomb was summoned from West Point to play the role of judge advocate to the court. Other trials followed that of Colonel Butler, and so well did Macomb perform the duties of judge advocate that the members of the court urged him to compose a treatise on the conduct of courts-martial. This work he carried out a few years later.  At the time of his service as judge advocate he was but twenty years of age.He remained at West Point until June, 1805, when he was promoted to a captaincy and ordered to Portsmouth to superintend certain harbor construction work.  The next year he was ordered to South Carolina, where he was stationed for several years.  The declaration of war upon Great Britain in IS12 found him a lieutenant colonel and chief engineer for the southern states.  As on other occasions, so on this, the American government blundered into war with a great military power ludicrously unprepared to conduct military operations. Belatedly and futilely an effort was made to develop an army to prosecute the war already at hand, and Macomb was summoned to Washington by the Secretary of War to assume the post of adjutant general of the army.  Although his duties were important, he was unwilling in time of war to remain aloof from the field of action.  Staff officers were not eligible, under the regulations then in force, to exercise active command, and Macomb secured his transfer to the artillery with the rank of colonel.  Repairing to New York, he proceeded to enlist and discipline the regiment to which he had been assigned. Toward the close of the year he marched it  to  Sackett's  Harbor  to  participate  in  an  attack  upon  Kingston; winter was at hand, however, and the projected attack was not carried out, and nothing of consequence could be undertaken until the following season.The conduct of the War of 1812 by our government was so11ALEXANDER MACOMB.11shamefully inefficient that no American can today read the story without being stirred to a sense of anger and disgust over the role our country was made to play.  Only occasionally is the dreary story of official ineptitude and general incompetence relieved by some story of individual achievement. To Macomb, who was a capable and zealous professional soldier, was accorded the opportunity to reap the glory of one of the most cheering interludes in the general tale of disaster which the war afforded to America.His opportunity came with the closing weeks of the war, in the autumn of 1814.  Until then, he had continued to serve creditably but inconspicuously on the Champlain-Ontario frontier, while older officers of higher rank monopolized the public eye and demonstrated repeatedly their incapacity to command an army.  Far from conquering Canada, the American dream at the beginning of the war, the United States was itself being invaded at points as widely separated as Louisiana, Virginia, and Maine; and British officialdom was seriously contemplating the permanent cession of northern New England to Canada, and the erection of the region northwest of the Ohio River as a permanent Indian preserve, from which American civilization should forever be excluded, as a condition to making peace with the United States.Such was the general aspect of affairs when, in August, 1814, Sir George Prevost led the strongest army Great Britain had ever sent to America southward from Montreal toward Lake Champlain. Eleven thousand of Wellesley's veterans, fresh from their triumphs over Napoleon in the Peninsular campaigns, comprised the bulk of the invading army.  Cooperating with it was a small naval force under Captain Downie, whose particular mission it was to destroy the little American fleet on Lake Champlain commanded by Commodore Thomas Macdonough.  The two naval forces were more or less evenly matched, and no one could reasonably foretell the issue of a conflict between them.   On land, the Americans opposed some five or six thousand regular troops under the command of General George lzard to the eleven thousand veterans led by Prevost.  But with a capacity for blundering which at times approached the character of genius, the Secretary of War on the very eve of the invasion ordered General lzard to conduct most of the army to a distant field of action.   Thus it came about that at the very moment when the Americans should have been hurrying every possible reinforcement to Lake Champlain to oppose Prevost's invading host, General lzard marched away toward distant Niagara with practically the entire army already on the ground.Left behind to defend the American position at Plattsburg was General Macomb with a "miscellaneous" force of 3,500 men.  The12BURTON HISTORICAL COLLECTION LEAFLET.12flower of the army had marched with lzard, and the men remaining at Plattsburg have not inaptly been characterized as its "culls." Macomb himself reports that his effective force did not exceed 1,500 in number.  To dispute with such a force the advance of Prevost's magnificent army was a project partaking of madness.  Yet far from abandoning the field, as he might with entire reason have done, Macomb marshalled [marshaled] his pitiful resources, and with unwearied energy and consummate skill prepared to give battle to the enemy.Prevost's advance was delayed for some days awaiting the appearance of Downie, whose fleet was to destroy Macdonough's flotilla while Prevost disposed of Macomb. Early in September, the invasion was begun in earnest.  Macomb sent out several detachments of riflemen and light troops with instructions to harass the advancing British columns, and by every possible means delay and oppose their progress.  So little attention did the veteran regiments pay to this opposition, however, that they did not once bother to deploy in line of battle, pressing steadily on in solid columns.  By September 6, they were opposite the American works, and the time until the eleventh was passed in making preparations for the assault, and awaiting the appearance of Downie.The battle of Plattsburg, fought on September II, was a combined land and naval action.  Macdonough had stationed his fleet in a position where Downie was compelled to attack under conditions favorable to the Americans.  The sequel of a furious battle of several hours' duration was the complete defeat of the invaders. Meanwhile Prevost's storming columns moved forward to their appointed task.  One column, led by General Robinson, moved by a circuitous route to attack the Americans in the rear, while others, assigned to storm the works in front, awaited, in readiness, for the sound of Robinson's attack, which was to be the signal for launching their own assault.  In preparation for such a contingency, Macomb had by night planted all the roads leading to his works with evergreens, and had the roadways strewn with fallen leaves so as to conceal all appearance of a pathway.  Not content with this, he had constructed other roads, all opening into an old way, which led, not to the works, but to Salmon River, and' on this he had posted his militia and a field piece to harass the enemy when he should appear.The intended consequence followed. The attacking columns lost their way, and the actual assault was delayed until the cheers of the Americans apprised the British of the disaster that had overtaken their fleet.  This development induced Prevost to abandon the invasion and return to Canada.  The attack upon the forts was not pressed, and the losses suffered on either side were but trifling.  To13ALEXANDER MACOMB.13the astonishment of the Americans, while they were still nerved to meet the expected assault, some British deserters came in with the word that General Prevost was retreating from his position.  So incredible was this report that it was not believed at once; but on the following morning full confirmation was seen in the abandoned baggage-wagons and other equipage which alone covered the field where a few hours earlier the great army had lain.The battle of Plattsburg, it will be seen, was chiefly fought on the water.   In describing it, most historians have centered their attention upon the naval battle, and have ascribed to Macdonough principal credit for hurling back the invaders.  That Macdonough performed splendidly his allotted task, is clear. A patriotic Canadian historian has characterized him as "an officer of whom any navy in the world might well be proud."  But the backing of the land force, supplied by Macomb, made his victory possible; and although the abandonment of the campaign by General Prevost denied to Macomb the glory of conducting a desperate defense, it is clear that his own skill and unremitting exertion in preparing for the defense was in large measure responsible for the denial.  Macdonough and Macomb were both young officers, (Macdonough was thirty-one, Macomb thirty-two, years of age) and both were a credit to the American nation.  At Plattsburg both reached the high-water-mark of their careers.  In their joint victory there was glory enough for both, and a grateful country bestowed fame in ample measure upon them. Macdonough's victory was essential to the American defense; it is equally clear that Macomb's resolute and skillful generalship made possible Macdonough's triumph.But for Prevost's humiliation at Plattsburg, the British would have ended the war triumphant on every front save that adjacent to Lake Erie, where Commodore Perry's victory of September 10, 1813, had given the Americans the ascendancy.4  They were prepared to demand, and the American government would have been compelled to yield, terms of peace which would have altered radically the entire course of future development of the nation.  Plattsburg ruined this agreeable prospect, and enabled the American negotiators of the Treaty of Ghent to obtain peace on the basis of a return to the status existing prior to the commencement of the war.  Instead of a forced and humiliating concession of the territory won by the War of the Revolution, the United States came out of the war with boundaries intact.  For this we are indebted to the victory of Plattsburg, and chiefly to the splendid leadership of the youthful commanders, Macomb and Macdonough.4The statement made ignores Jackson's victory at New Orleans, which came after the treaty of peace had been signed, and had no influence upon its negotiation.14BURTON HISTORICAL COLLECTION LEAFLET.14The war ended on Christmas Eve, 1814, although several weeks were to pass before the fact became known in America.5  The return of peace entailed a reduction of the army, whose peace-time establishment was fixed at 10,000 men with two major generals and four brigadiers.  Macomb was retained in the service with the rank of senior brigadier general, assigned to command the Third Military Department with headquarters in New York.  Before long he was transferred to the Fifth Department with headquarters in Detroit.Thus it came to pass that he returned to the city of his birth, there to reside from 1816 until 1831.  The unsettled conditions prevailing throughout the Northwest in this period rendered Macomb's station of commanding general one of great importance and difficulty. Under his direction posts were established at Mackinac, Green Bay, Chicago, St. Paul, Prairie du Chien, and Sault Ste. Marie.  Their history is intimately interwoven with the early annals of their respective regions.   Most important of all the northwestern posts, of course, was Detroit, where Macomb exercised control in person. Discord between the army and civilians was a normal feature of life on 'the frontier.  Macomb, however, possessed a rare faculty of getting on with the public, and the years of his administration in Detroit were wholly free from civilian discord.  On the eve of his removal to another station, in the spring of 1821, the townsmen united to present him a silver tankard as a testimonial of their esteem.  The somewhat stilted address composed by Judge Augustus B. Woodward to accompany the presentation affirmed that no official and no citizen of Detroit had ever found occasion for complaint against the General's administration.  For one whose entire career had been spent in the regular army, and who now for half a dozen years had commanded a garrison in the midst of a busy civilian community, this was a significant tribute.The occasion of Macomb's removal from Detroit was the general curtailment of the army which was effected in 1821.  Reduced to the rank of colonel, he was returned to his old employment as chief of the engineer department of the army with headquarters in Washington.  Here he continued to serve until the death of General Jacob Brown, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, in February, 1828. Strange as it may seem, since the War of 1812 the government had neglected to prescribe the order of succession to the position of commander-in-chief; on the death of General Brown, therefore, the rival claims of several officers to the succession were ardently advanced by their friends, and it was even gravely affirmed that one need not even belong to the army to be eligible for the appointment.5The Treaty reached Washington, February 14.  It was not known at Detroit until about the beginning of March.15ALEXANDER MACOMB.15The President solved the problem by the appointment of Macomb, who in May, 1828, became a major general and commander-in-chief of the army.The boy who was born in a foreign land (Detroit was under the rule of Great Britain until 1796)  had now achieved the highest station his chosen profession opened to him.  For his conduct at Plattsburg he had received the warmest expressions of appreciation of the national government, of the States-of New York and Virginia, and of the City of New York.  His administration of the army lasted thirteen years, from 1828 until his death in 1841.  Indian wars aside, it was an era of peace for the nation, and no opportunity to win spectacular distinction was afforded Macomb in this period. From the point of view of his military glory this was a great misfortune ; had Macomb lived a few years longer, there is every reason to suppose that the fame achieved by Taylor and Scott in the Mexican War would have been garnered, instead, by him. As it was, he played well his part throughout his entire career, winning the steadfast approval alike of his associates in the army, his civilian superiors in public life, and of the masses of his countrymen.   More solid achievement than this could scarcely be anticipated, or desired.To complete his story it remains to speak of his private life. In July, 1803, he married his cousin, Catherine Macomb, who was born in Detroit, October 30, 1787, and was now a maiden of almost sixteen summers.  Apparently it was an ideal union.  To be with her husband in his numerous changes of station, Mrs. Macomb "encountered the perils of climate in the North and in the South, and of travel by land, and sea, and lake.  She dared the hazards of war, in camp and garrison; and found a shield from all dangers and sorrows in her husband's arms."  Before her death in 1822 she had become the mother of twelve children.6Three of these died in early childhood, and two in early maturity.  Both the remaining sons  followed military careers, and most of the five remaining daughters married into the army or navy. Alexander Saranac, born June 3, 1814, entered West Point in 1830, was graduated, and attained the rank of major before resigning his commission in 1841.  In 1840 he married Susan Kearny of New York, sister of General Philip Kearny of Mexican and Civil War fame.  William Henry, the remaining son, who was born in Detroit in 1819, entered the U. S. navy as a midshipman in 1834 and died with the rank of commodore in 1872.  He married a daughter of General Henry Stanton, whose second wife was his elder sister, Alexandrine Macomb.6On May 26, 1826, General Macomb married Mrs. Harriet Balch Wilson of Georgetown.  No children were born of this union, and nothing has been learned by the present writer concerning Mrs. Wilson's career.16BURTON HISTORICAL COLLECTION LEAFLET.16Catherine, eldest daughter of General Alexander Macomb, in 1821 married John Mason Jr. of Virginia, son of the author of the famous Bill of Rights, and himself secretary of the U. S. legation to Mexico.   Alexandrine, born in 1808, in 1834 married Henry Stanton, colonel and brevet brigadier general in the army.  He died in 1856 at Fort Hamilton, New York, where he had long been stationed, and where all of their seven children were born.  Czarina, born in 1810, married her- cousin, John Navarre Macomb of New York, who spent his life in the army, and retired with the rank of colonel in 1883.  Mrs. Macomb died in 1846 and the widower later married a daughter of Commodore John Rodgers of the U. S. navy. A son of this union was Montgomery Meigs Macomb, who retired from the army in 1917 with the rank of brigadier general.  Sarah Macomb, who was born in Detroit in March, 1831, only a few weeks before her father's removal from this place, married Henry Whiting Stanton, son of General Henry Stanton, who likewise was a native of Detroit.  He was graduated from West Point in 1842, attained the rank of captain, and was slain in a fight with the Apache in 1855.7  The widow subsequently married John Charles Devereux Williams, son of John R. Williams of Detroit.  The last of General Macomb's daughters, for whom her mother's life was given, was Jane Octavia, born in Georgetown, September 17, 1883. True to the family tradition, she married in 1841, Morris S, Miller, a graduate of West Point in 1831 and a lieutenant in the army, who attained the rank of brevet brigadier general in the Civil War.7Fort Stanton, New Mexico, was named in his memory.Marshall Davies Lloyd#*#
 Biographies of the Pioneers of Grosse IleAlexander & William Macomb:  The first legal owners of Grosse Ile, were born in Ireland and came to America with their parents, John and Jane (Gordon) Macomb, in 1755, at the ages of seven and four.  There was also a sister, Anne.  The brothers became large real estate owner, in New York, as well as in Michigan.  At one time they owned nearly all the islands in the Detroit River, acquiring Grosse Ile, in 1776.  It would seem that later they sold much of the land on Grosse Ile, as some of the early pioneers bought tracts at a public sale of lands in New York.The Macomb brothers possessed wonderful business ability, carry on an enormous mercantile business, with its headquarters in Detroit, reaching not only to the colonies, but into Canada as well.  They were often referred to as "merchant princes."Alexander Macomb, the elder brother (later the father of Major General Alexander Macomb) married, first to Catherine Navarre, the daughter of Robert Navarre, who was Notaire Royal of the French colony at Detroit, from the first establishment of the colony.  There were nine children from this marriage, the seventh being Alexander Macomb Jr, who is the only one of the nine children to have descendants still living on the island.  His daughter, Alexandrine, married an officer in the army named, Stanton, and from them, came the Stanton residents.Alexander Sr's second wife, Jane Rucker, widow of John Peter Rucker, a merchant in New York.  By her he had seven more children, total of sixteen in all.  None of these descendants lived on Grosse Ile.William Macomb Sr, married Sarah Jane Dring, a descendant of a Huguenot family who fled from France to England after the Edict of Nantes had been revoked.  They had eleven children.  William Macomb Jr, and his sister, Sarah Macomb-Rucker are closely identified with the early history of Grosse Ile, ten heads of families in 1880 being direct descendants of this brother and sister.  William Sr, some years previous to the surrender of Detroit, by Hull, built a beautiful home on Grosse Ile, which he named the "Mansion House", after his New York residence at 39 Broadway, near Old Trinity Church. The later had been built by him in 1786 as a family residence, and was at one time Washington's headquarters, where he received from LaFayette, through Thomas Paine, the Key of the Bastille.  He died in Detroit April 16, 1796.  Aside from providing well for his family, he left an annuity to his aged father.William Macomb Jr was the sixth child of this family.  His father, in his wiill,  had left all of this real estate to his three sons,  John W., William, and David B. Macomb.  It would seem that the Grosse Ile properties fell into the hands of William Jr, for about the time of the War of 1812, he was occupying the Mansion House, with his young wife, Monique Navarre, and their son,  Pierre, and servants.  When the prisoners at the time of Hull's surrender were taken from Detroit to Toronto, on the Brig Queen Charlotte William Jr was among them, along with another Detroit native resident, Judge Abbott.  William had incurred the displeasure of the Fox Indian Tribe by having a sweetheart in their tribe, who , upon hearing that he had married a French lady, drowned herself.  The Natives, for revenge, decided to destroy his home.  One evening, Mrs Macomb, alone and unprotected with her son and servants, saw a number of small boats moving quietly toward the shore.  It proved to be a small fleet of canoes filled with Native Americans.  Fearing some evil she hurriedly gave the alarm to her household, and wrapped her baby in a blanket and started for the forest behind the house.  There, she saw the Native Americans dancing around the ruins of her burning home, and dared not proceed until they returned to their boats.How she made the dreadful journey to Detroit is not known.  There was only one bridge across the River, at the upper end of the island.  Some small boat could have taken her to Trenton,, and from there on foot she probably traveled the 18 miles to Detroit, in the dark night sky.  She reached friends in the village, and soon after she died of pneumonia, the result of exposure, in November 1813.  Baby  Pierre was born in 1812, and according to family records, died in 1866, unmarried.Some years later, William married a second time, to  Jeanette Marentete, and rebuilt further south, but still on the area of Mansion Block.  This tract extended entirely across the island, and the Rucker, Keith and Smith farms, later occupied the western portions.   Jeanette brought forth four children; a son,  Tronville, who left home when he was quite young and was never heard from; and three daughters, Jane, Archange and  Catherine, all of whom married and lived side by side until their deaths.  Jane , the eldest, married Lieutenant Henry Brevoort.  Their eldest son, William a lieutenant in the Civil War, met his death by Colonel Thornton Brodhead's regiment.   Henry, the second son, was a prominent lawyer in Detroit for many years. Thornton, the youngest, died before Henry, having lived as a resident of Grosse Ile.Archange, the second sister, married Colonel Thornton Brodhead (the same man who's regiment killed  William) and bore six children, Josephine, Marian, John, Ellen, Katherine and Elizabeth.  Josephine married a Canadian government officer,  Balfour, and lived in Toronto.  Marian  married John K. Webster. John married the niece of Nathaniel P. Willis, a author in Detroit, and Elizabeth married Frederick Howard.Catherine Macomb married John Wendell, and had a large family:  Oscar, Catherine, Mary, Susan, Jane, Edith, , and Lilian.  Of these only 3 remained as residents of Grosse Ile, Edith, Oscar and Lilian.William Macomb Jr met his death from a kick by an ox, and was buried on land that his son would have inherited, had he returned.  When her children were grown, Mrs Macomb remarried to Thomas Lewis, and had one daughter, Eliza.  Eliza later married Dallas Norvell.About 3 miles below the Macomb Mansion House stood the old Stockade.  It was built on the eastern river bank, on land belonging to Alexander Macomb, who was then commander in chief of the Army in Detroit.  It extended from the river several hundred feet west, bordering on the north near the old Lowrie home, then south about 200 feet, and back to the river, enclosing several acres.  There was an entrance to the barracks on the north, and another leading down stone steps to the water on the east.  There were seven log houses within the enclosure; a large one with a hall extending through the center, running east and west, with three rooms on each side.  There were the officer's quarters.  Two smaller buildings at the rear, and two near the front formed the soldier's quarters.  Several of the buildings were put together with wooden pins and hanging doors.  Joining the larger building at the west was a frame part, added for a kitchen.  Wrought iron nails were used for this building.  A root house for vegetables stood on the northeast corner, and five poplar trees were planted along the front.This fort was built as a protection against the Native Americans, who frequently made raids on the livestock.  About 1815, the Native Americans had become so troublesome, terrifying the families, that it was considered necessary to provide a guard.  A boat load of soldiers, under Corporal John B. Jones of the 5th United States infantry, was sent to prevent further disorder.  One incidence concerning William Macomb was when a tribe of Kickapoo landed  and surrounded settlers, and starting taking prisoners.  One Kickapoo fired upon Macomb, however by being quicker, he had shot the Native first.  Old pioneers had said that this Native American was buried under a basswood tree, which stood on the bank, overlooking the ravine, and during construction of a road, a skeleton was unearthed on the hillside, where the fallen brave was said to have been interred.  This tree was known as the "Treaty Tree".  The old basswood itself is gone, but a small tree marks this spot, and some older residents claim to have pictures of this tree.John Anthony Rucker: was an early pioneer, coming in the year 1819.  Mrs Rucker was a sister of William Macomb.  Eight children were born to them.   General Henry Rucker, the oldest, was in the regular army many years.  He resigned and resided in Washington with his two older daughters, Louise and  Sarah.  His youngest daughter, Irene, was the wife of General Sheridan.  General Rucker had two sons, Frank and Anthony, who followed their father in the army.  His eldest son, Ross died in Grosse Ile when he was a young boy.  Frank, also died at a young age.   Anthony  lost his life while trying to save the life of a companion.  While crossing a wild mountain stream they were caught in the waters, and both men and horses drowned.  Lieutenant Anthony Rucker was buried at Fort Rucker in Arizona, and later his remains were removed to Arlington.Maria Rucker married an Episcopal clergyman, Reverend Charles Fox.  Their home was located on what is now the Country Club.  The land was bought by Louis Rucker, Sr, who also had the house built on the west shore.  They lived there many years.  Four son were born.  When they were ready for college the residence was given back to the brother of Mrs Fox, Louis D. Rucker, and the  Fox family moved to Ann Arbor. Their sons, George, Crofton, William, and Charles all graduated from the University of Michigan.Louis D Rucker, and his wife, Eliza Smith, lived at the old Fox  home until their deaths.  Katherine, the eldest of their four children, died in her early twenties.  Richard, the second child, died of a gunshot wound at an early age.  Louis and Dean the two youngest, married, and Louis settled in the old Rucker  home, while Dean settled in Detroit.John Rucker Jr married Jane Keith, the youngest daughter of Captain William Keith, and built the "Stanton" house for his bride.  Three sons were born to them:  Henry, who died in infancy, Macomb, and Louis.  Louis went west and died in Colorado, and Macomb married Abbie Sunderland and had one son, Keith Rucker.Sarah Rucker married an English gentleman named, Hentig.  He bought a tract of land and built what is now the Lowrie home.  There were six children: Frederick, Alfred, Edmund, Jane, Cass and  Frank.  Only Alfred, Edmund and Jane remained Grosse Ile residents.  Edmund became an army man, and lost his life in Custer's "Last Stand."  Jane, was a loyal resident of her island home, and an active church member.Catherine Rucker was born during a period when their house was undergoing repairs, and the family was occupying one of the old stockade buildings.  She married  Lieutenant Whitall, of the United States Army.  Their son,  Samuel Whitall, built a handsome home on the east side of the island, which he and his family occupied until his death.  Their daughter, Lily remained unmarried, and their son Frank resided on property of the old Alex Keith farm.Eliza Rucker, the youngest of John A. Rucker's family, married George Truax a Trenton  merchant.  He was the brother of Mrs. Abram Slocum.Four generations lived in the Rucker  home.  The last being Louis Jr, with his wife and their four children.William Keith:  Captain William Keith with his family, came to Grosse Ile in the same year as John A. Rucker, 1819.  He was born in Paisley, Scotland, married an Irish lady, Jane Dick, and lived in Washington some years.  He sailed the seas to and from many ports.  Denmark and Canton, in the old log books are proofs of some of his far journeys.  While in Washington he refitted the brig, "Wasp" and sailed it for some time.  Later this ship was to become famous in the War of 1812, at Perry's Victory, after which it disappeared.  In leaving it Captain Keith must have taken with him a keepsake, for in the garret of the old Keith home stood a ship's clock, on a glass door, with a tiny ship painted on it, marked "Wasp".Captain Keith commanded the first revenue cutter on the Lake, and was sent to Mackinac Island to drive the British from it, but they had evacuated.  He returned in time to get into the Battle of Lake Erie, and fought through it.  His boat was taken for a hospital.  The Queen Charlotte, which carried the prisoners from Detroit to Toronto, after Hull's surrender, was also in the battle.  It was sunk and afterward bought and raised by a New York company, and Captain Keith sailed it for 5 additional years.  He then brought his family from Alexanderia, near Washington, to Grosse Ile, where a log house was built in 1819.  In 1829, their colonial house was built.  Six of his eight children were born there.  In the early 1850s, and after the death of Captain Keith, Mrs. Keith received a Land Grant from the Government, "for services rendered by Captain Keith at Perry's  Victory".The eldest son, William, died in infancy.

PLEASE REMOVE #*#geoguide#*# Biographies of the Pioneers of Grosse Ile#*#Alexander & William Macomb:#*#  The first legal owners of #*#Grosse Ile#*#, were born in Ireland and came to America with their parents, #*#John#*# and #*#Jane (Gordon) Macomb#*#, in 1755, at the ages of seven and four.  There was also a sister, #*#Anne#*#.  The brothers became large real estate owner, in New York, as well as in Michigan.  At one time they owned nearly all the islands in the #*#Detroit River#*#, acquiring #*#Grosse Ile#*#, in 1776.  It would seem that later they sold much of the land on #*#Grosse Ile#*#, as some of the early pioneers bought tracts at a public sale of lands in New York.#*#The #*#Macomb#*# brothers possessed wonderful business ability, carry on an enormous mercantile business, with its headquarters in #*#Detroit#*#, reaching not only to the colonies, but into Canada as well.  They were often referred to as "merchant princes."#*#Alexander Macomb#*#, the elder brother (later the father of Major General Alexander Macomb) married, first to #*#Catherine Navarre#*#, the daughter of #*#Robert Navarre#*#, who was Notaire Royal of the French colony at #*#Detroit#*#, from the first establishment of the colony.  There were nine children from this marriage, the seventh being #*#Alexander Macomb Jr#*#, who is the only one of the nine children to have descendants still living on the island.  His daughter, #*#Alexandrine#*#, married an officer in the army named, #*#Stanton#*#, and from them, came the #*#Stanton#*# residents.#*#Alexander#*# Sr's second wife, #*#Jane Rucker#*#, widow of #*#John Peter Rucker#*#, a merchant in New York.  By her he had seven more children, total of sixteen in all.  None of these descendants lived on #*#Grosse Ile#*#.#*#William Macomb#*# Sr, married #*#Sarah Jane Dring#*#, a descendant of a Huguenot family who fled from France to England after the Edict of Nantes had been revoked.  They had eleven children.  #*#William Macomb Jr#*#, and his sister,#*# Sarah Macomb-Rucker#*# are closely identified with the early history of #*#Grosse Ile#*#, ten heads of families in 1880 being direct descendants of this brother and sister.  #*#William Sr#*#, some years previous to the surrender of #*#Detroit#*#, by #*#Hull#*#, built a beautiful home on #*#Grosse Ile#*#, which he named the "Mansion House", after his New York residence at 39 Broadway, near Old Trinity Church. The later had been built by him in 1786 as a family residence, and was at one time Washington's headquarters, where he received from #*#LaFayette#*#, through #*#Thomas Paine#*#, the Key of the Bastille.  He died in #*#Detroit#*# April 16, 1796.  Aside from providing well for his family, he left an annuity to his aged father.#*#William Macomb Jr#*# was the sixth child of this family.  His father, in his wiill,  had left all of this real estate to his three sons, #*# John W., William#*#, and #*#David B.#*# Macomb.  It would seem that the #*#Grosse Ile#*# properties fell into the hands of #*#William Jr#*#, for about the time of the War of 1812, he was occupying the Mansion House, with his young wife, #*#Monique Navarre#*#, and their son, #*# Pierre#*#, and servants.  When the prisoners at the time of #*#Hull's#*# surrender were taken from #*#Detroit#*# to Toronto, on the #*#Brig Queen Charlotte#*# #*#William Jr#*# was among them, along with another #*#Detroit#*# native resident,#*# Judge Abbott#*#.  #*#William#*# had incurred the displeasure of the #*#Fox Indian Tribe#*# by having a sweetheart in their tribe, who , upon hearing that he had married a French lady, drowned herself.  The Natives, for revenge, decided to destroy his home.  One evening, #*#Mrs Macomb#*#, alone and unprotected with her son and servants, saw a number of small boats moving quietly toward the shore.  It proved to be a small fleet of canoes filled with Native Americans.  Fearing some evil she hurriedly gave the alarm to her household, and wrapped her baby in a blanket and started for the forest behind the house.  There, she saw the Native Americans dancing around the ruins of her burning home, and dared not proceed until they returned to their boats.#*#How she made the dreadful journey to #*#Detroit#*# is not known.  There was only one bridge across the River, at the upper end of the island.  Some small boat could have taken her to #*#Trenton,#*#, and from there on foot she probably traveled the 18 miles to #*#Detroit#*#, in the dark night sky.  She reached friends in the village, and soon after she died of pneumonia, the result of exposure, in November 1813.  Baby #*# Pierre#*# was born in 1812, and according to family records, died in 1866, unmarried.#*#Some years later, #*#William#*# married a second time, to #*# Jeanette Marentete#*#, and rebuilt further south, but still on the area of #*#Mansion Block#*#.  This tract extended entirely across the island, and the #*#Rucker, Keith#*# and #*#Smith#*# farms, later occupied the western portions.  #*# Jeanette#*# brought forth four children; a son, #*# Tronville#*#, who left home when he was quite young and was never heard from; and three daughters, #*#Jane, Archange#*# and #*# Catherine#*#, all of whom married and lived side by side until their deaths.  #*#Jane #*#, the eldest, married #*#Lieutenant Henry Brevoort#*#.  Their eldest son, #*#William#*# a lieutenant in the Civil War, met his death by Colonel Thornton Brodhead's regiment.  #*# Henry#*#, the second son, was a prominent lawyer in #*#Detroit#*# for many years. #*#Thornton#*#, the youngest, died before #*#Henry#*#, having lived as a resident of #*#Grosse Ile#*#.#*#Archange#*#, the second sister, married #*#Colonel Thornton Brodhead#*# (the same man who's regiment killed #*# William#*#) and bore six children, #*#Josephine, Marian, John, Ellen, Katherine#*# and #*#Elizabeth#*#.  #*#Josephine#*# married a Canadian government officer, #*# Balfour#*#, and lived in Toronto.  #*#Marian #*# married #*#John K. Webster#*#. #*#John#*# married the niece of #*#Nathaniel P. Willis#*#, a author in #*#Detroit#*#, and #*#Elizabeth#*# married #*#Frederick Howard#*#.#*#Catherine Macomb#*# married #*#John Wendell#*#, and had a large family:  #*#Oscar, Catherine, Mary, Susan, Jane, Edith, #*#, and #*#Lilian#*#.  Of these only 3 remained as residents of #*#Grosse Ile, Edith, Oscar and Lilian.William Macomb Jr met his death from a kick by an ox, and was buried on land that his son would have inherited, had he returned.  When her children were grown, Mrs Macomb remarried to Thomas Lewis, and had one daughter, Eliza.  Eliza later married Dallas Norvell.About 3 miles below the Macomb Mansion House stood the old Stockade.  It was built on the eastern river bank, on land belonging to Alexander Macomb, who was then commander in chief of the Army in Detroit.  It extended from the river several hundred feet west, bordering on the north near the old Lowrie home, then south about 200 feet, and back to the river, enclosing several acres.  There was an entrance to the barracks on the north, and another leading down stone steps to the water on the east.  There were seven log houses within the enclosure; a large one with a hall extending through the center, running east and west, with three rooms on each side.  There were the officer's quarters.  Two smaller buildings at the rear, and two near the front formed the soldier's quarters.  Several of the buildings were put together with wooden pins and hanging doors.  Joining the larger building at the west was a frame part, added for a kitchen.  Wrought iron nails were used for this building.  A root house for vegetables stood on the northeast corner, and five poplar trees were planted along the front.This fort was built as a protection against the Native Americans, who frequently made raids on the livestock.  About 1815, the Native Americans had become so troublesome, terrifying the families, that it was considered necessary to provide a guard.  A boat load of soldiers, under Corporal John B. Jones of the 5th United States infantry, was sent to prevent further disorder.  One incidence concerning William Macomb was when a tribe of Kickapoo landed  and surrounded settlers, and starting taking prisoners.  One Kickapoo fired upon Macomb, however by being quicker, he had shot the Native first.  Old pioneers had said that this Native American was buried under a basswood tree, which stood on the bank, overlooking the ravine, and during construction of a road, a skeleton was unearthed on the hillside, where the fallen brave was said to have been interred.  This tree was known as the "Treaty Tree".  The old basswood itself is gone, but a small tree marks this spot, and some older residents claim to have pictures of this tree.John Anthony Rucker:#*# was an early pioneer, coming in the year 1819.  Mrs Rucker was a sister of #*#William Macomb#*#.  Eight children were born to them.  #*# General Henry Rucker#*#, the oldest, was in the regular army many years.

Four son were born.  When they were ready for college the residence was given back to the brother of #*#Mrs Fox#*#, #*#Louis D. Rucker#*#, and the #*# Fox#*# family moved to #*#Ann Arbor#*#. Their sons,#*# George, Crofton, William#*#, and #*#Charles#*# all graduated from the University of Michigan.#*#Louis D Rucker#*#, and his wife, #*#Eliza Smith#*#, lived at the old #*#Fox #*# home until their deaths.  #*#Katherine#*#, the eldest of their four children, died in her early twenties.  #*#Richard#*#, the second child, died of a gunshot wound at an early age.  #*#Louis#*# and #*#Dean#*# the two youngest, married, and #*#Louis#*# settled in the old #*#Rucker #*# home, while #*#Dean#*# settled in #*#Detroit#*#.#*#John Rucker Jr#*# married #*#Jane Keith#*#, the youngest daughter of #*#Captain William Keith#*#, and built the "Stanton" house for his bride.

Only #*#Alfred, Edmund#*# and #*#Jane#*# remained #*#Grosse Ile#*# residents.  #*#Edmund#*# became an army man, and lost his life in Custer's "Last Stand."  #*#Jane#*#, was a loyal resident of her island home, and an active church member.#*#Catherine Rucker#*# was born during a period when their house was undergoing repairs, and the family was occupying one of the old stockade buildings.  She married #*# Lieutenant Whitall#*#, of the United States Army.  Their son, #*# Samuel Whitall#*#, built a handsome home on the east side of the island, which he and his family occupied until his death.  Their daughter, #*#Lily#*# remained unmarried, and their son #*#Frank#*# resided on property of the old #*#Alex Keith#*# farm.#*#Eliza Rucker#*#, the youngest of #*#John A.

Rucker#*#, 1819.  He was born in Paisley, Scotland, married an Irish lady, #*#Jane Dick#*#, and lived in Washington some years.  He sailed the seas to and from many ports.  Denmark and Canton, in the old log books are proofs of some of his far journeys.  While in Washington he refitted the brig, "Wasp" and sailed it for some time.  Later this ship was to become famous in the War of 1812, at Perry's Victory, after which it disappeared.  In leaving it #*#Captain Keith#*# must have taken with him a keepsake, for in the garret of the old #*#Keith#*# home stood a ship's clock, on a glass door, with a tiny ship painted on it, marked "Wasp".#*#Captain Keith#*# commanded the first revenue cutter on the Lake, and was sent to Mackinac Island to drive the British from it, but they had evacuated.  He returned in time to get into the Battle of Lake Erie, and fought through it.  His boat was taken for a hospital.  The Queen Charlotte, which carried the prisoners from #*#Detroit#*# to Toronto, after Hull's surrender, was also in the battle.  It was sunk and afterward bought and raised by a New York company, and #*#Captain Keith#*# sailed it for 5 additional years.  He then brought his family from Alexanderia, near Washington, to #*#Grosse Ile#*#, where a log house was built in 1819.  In 1829, their colonial house was built.  Six of his eight children were born there.  In the early 1850s, and after the death of #*#Captain Keith#*#, #*#Mrs. Keith#*# received a Land Grant from the Government, "for services rendered by #*#Captain Keith#*# at Perry's  Victory".#*#The eldest son, #*#William#*#, died in infancy.

Alexander Macomb, Sr. - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Alexander Macomb, Sr.From Wikipedia, the free encyclopediaJump to: navigation, search Alexander Macomb, Sr. was a prosperous merchant with Loyalist sympathies during the American Revolution. Macomb was born in Belfast, Ireland in 1748 and died in Georgetown, District of Columbia, USA in 1831.In Detroit, Michigan, during the Revolution, along with his brother, William Macomb, he traded with British and Native Americans, giving them supplies in exchange for furs.After the war, Macomb moved to New York City and became a land speculator and shipping magnate, purchasing tracts of land in Georgia, Kentucky, and North Carolina. In 1788, he built a magnificent home, which in 1790 was leased to become the president's home, occupied by George Washington.In 1791, Alexander Macomb purchased the largest tract yet, from the State of New York, 3,670,715 acres (14,855 km²), since known as "Macomb's Purchase." The tract included much of northern New York, along the St. Lawrence River and eastern Lake Ontario, including the Thousand Islands, at about twelve cents an acre. The purchase was divided into ten large townships. From this purchase are derived the deeds for all the lands that are now included in Lewis, Jefferson, St. Lawrence, and Franklin Counties, as well as portions of Herkimer and Oswego Counties.The enterprise was a failure; sales of land did not keep pace with the due dates for payments, and Macomb was taken to debtor's prison during the Panic of 1792, over $300,000 in debt.

One For AllOne For All ...by Ann Douglas        Stepping into the building vestibule,Stephanie Morgan shook the water from herumbrella. It had only been a little over two blockwalk from the bus stop, but she had gotten soakednevertheless. Opening her raincoat, the 24 yearold blond made an attempt to shake that dry aswell.        It had been bad luck that her brotherJerry’s car had picked tonight of all nights not tostart up.  He had promised to drop her off at herfriend Rachel’s new apartment. No matter, shereluctantly concluded, at least she was here now.        "Lets see,"  she mused as she ran herfinger across the row of intercom buttons."Alexander ... Markham ... Ford ...  here it is,Lieberman, 5B"        It took a few moments to get a response,then a semi-distorted voice filtered through thespeaker.        "Hello?"  the female voice asked.        "Rachel, it’s me Stef."  she replied.        "Come on up," Rachel said as the buzzersounded and the inner door unlocked.  "I’m in theshower."          "She’s in the shower?"  Stephanie laughedas she glanced back out into the rain coveredstreet.         As she walked up the stairs to the fifthfloor apartment, Stephanie couldn’t help but envyher girlfriends new accommodations.  To someonestill living at home, the small apartment complexmight has well been a palace. There was no waythe salesgirl could afford a place like this on hersalary.          Of course Rachel really couldn’t afford aplace like this on her salary either.  The buildingwas owned by Martin Lieberman, who whenasked by his widowed sister-in-law to help herdaughter find an apartment was more than happyto find her this one.  It was a small thing to makea woman he’d admired for years happy.  Besides,having his niece living here assured him a honestpair of eyes to watch over his investment.         Reaching the fifth floor of the smallapartment building, Stephanie found that therewere some limits to Mr. Lieberman's generosityafter all.  Apartment 5B was a small studioapartment, one of three on the top floor.  Tryingthe door, she found it unlocked and steppedinside.        "Rachel," the blue eyed blond called out asshe closed the door behind her.        "I'm in here, Stef," came a reply from the bathroom, a voice much more recognizable thanthe one that had come over the intercom.  "Makeyourself comfortable and  I'll be out in a fewminutes."            Hanging her coat, on the rack by the door,Stephanie checked the short red dress she waswearing.  It was a little damp but otherwise okay.She had gotten home late and didn’t have time tochange clothes.          As she waited, Stephanie took in hersurroundings.  The apartment might be small, butit had a certain charm.  The first feature shenoticed were large twin skylights in the ceiling. The soft patter of rain could be heard againstthem.  On a clear day or night, they would give anice natural light to the room.        On the far left, a large bay window alsoadded to the natural light.  The view beyond itwas nothing special, but it was a nice feature.  A kitchenette over by the bathroom entranceconsisted of a small refrigerator, a stovetop and microwave. And of course a kitchen sink.        There really wasn't much in the way ofdecoration on the walls, but then Rachel had onlybeen living there a few weeks.  The center of theroom was dominated by a large green oversizedU-shaped sofa.  In addition to the deep cushions,it was covered with equally push and oversizedpillows.  Rachel had mentioned to her that sheused the sofa in place of a bed.        At the open end of the couch was one ofthose small self assembly entertainment centers, the bottom of  which was filled with her friend'sold stereo system . What was new was the large35-inch color television, a housewarming gift fromRachel's grandmother.  The couch had been onefrom her mother.        On both sides of the television were someframed photographs.  One brought a smile toStephanie’s face. The 5 x 7 picture was veryfamiliar to the 24 year old.  A smaller version wasstuck in the mirror frame in her own bedroom. The picture had been taken last summer at theOakdale Mall Talent Show.        Centered in the picture was Rachel ofcourse.  She always had to be the center ofattention.  To her right was Stephanie herself.That was when her hair had been down toher shoulders, rather than the short curly look shenow wore.        To Rachel's left was a much smaller girl,whose mixed Philippine, Chinese and Spanishheritage had given her a soft brown complexion. Her very short black hair and unisex featuresgave her an androgynous look.  In fact, if it wasn'tfor the small mounds protruding from her chest,she might've been mistaken for a teenage boy. Her name was Annie Liu, but everyone called herPenny.  Despite her teenage looks, she was 20years old.        The last member of the quartet was a tallblack woman standing just behind and to theleft of Rachel. Five foot ten, she stood half a headtaller than any of the others, more than that inthe case of Penny's five two. Her skin was ebonyblack, a sharp contrast to both Rachel andStephanie.  Most men first noticed her somewhatample bust.  In the case of women it was her jetblack hair which she usually wore in an elaboratedesign.  At 26, Pamela Wilson was the oldestmember of their little band.        All four women worked at the OakdaleMall. Rachel was a medical assistant.  Stephaniewas a sales representative at one of the large department stores.  Penny worked at her unclesrestaurant. She was also a college student. Pamela was the associate manager of  an officesupply store.        Despite their differences in ages andbackgrounds, they had all become friends overcountless shared lunches.  Soon their friendshipshad extended beyond work.  The picture hadcaptured one of the highlights of that friendship. Billing themselves as the Four Musketeers, sonamed because those were the only costumes theycould find, they had entered the talent showas a singing group.  It was more fun than hardwork and the money went to charity.  To theirsurprise, they finished in second place.  Since thenthey still jokingly referred to themselves as theFour Musketeers.        "We'd have gotten first,"  Stephaniethought as she replaced the picture on theentertainment center. "If we paraded around halfnaked like Judy Peterman.  The judges weremore impressed by her big nipples stickingthrough her blouse than her singing."        "Any sign of the rain letting up?"  Rachelasked as she walked out of the bathroom.        "No, it looks like tonight’s a totalwashout."  Stephanie replied as she turned aroundat the sound of her voice.        "A pity."  Rachel commented as shewalked over to Stephanie and kissed her on thecheek as a friendly hello.        Covered only by a large bath towel thatshe had wrapped around herself, Rachel walkedover to a large dresser that lined the far wall, stilldrying her hair as she walked.        "It really sucks that it had to rain tonight" Rachel said , pulling a pair of panties and anoversized T-shirt from the top drawer.  "I waslooking forward to that concert."        The original plan for the evening was for agirls night out.  One of their favorite local bandswas holding an open air concert in Marshall Park.They'd planned to take dinner a couple of blanketsand a few bottles of wine out to enjoy the music. Unfortunately Mother Nature had other ideas.  Sorather than let the night go to waste, they haddecided to have a girl's night in instead.        "Penny and Pamela are picking up thefood." Rachel said as she unwrapped the towelfrom around her and let it fall to the floor.  "I'mnot sure what they're getting, but knowing Pamelait's sure to be something interesting." she added asshe stood there nude as the day she was born.        "I guess so." Stephanie replied in anstrained tone.        Silly as she knew it was, Stephanie felt it alittle strange for her friend to be standing nude infront of her as they continued their conversation. It wasn't of course the first time she'd seen Rachelnaked.  They'd gone to the beach many times, aswell as clothes shopping both together and as partof the group.  They'd shared dressing rooms manytimes, but somehow it now seemed different --somewhat out of context maybe, standing nakedin the living room.  Then she reminded herself thatthis was also Rachel's bedroom, a place where itwas perfectly natural for her to be nude.        Stephanie also considered that she feltuncomfortable because when they'd first met,Rachel and she had almost the same physicalbuild, the main difference being Rachel's darkerbrown hair and slightly larger breasts.  Thatdifference had grown to more than a few poundsof extra weight on Stephanie. Despite assurancesfrom many of her friends that she looked betterwith the extra weight, which was still within thenorm for her size, she always felt self-consciousabout it. It was an outgrowth of her teen yearswhen she had actually been overweight.        It didn't take Rachel long to put on thepair of panties and the T-shirt she had taken out.Since she was home and not planning to go out,she didn't see the need for anything more.  Withher breasts still a little damp, Rachel's much darkernipples clearly showed through the thin cotton.        "Judy Peterman would’ve been  proud." Stephanie thought with a laugh as her discomfortpassed.        Fifteen minutes passed as the two of themsat on the couch and chatted. They had seeneach other that morning so it was more a matterof killing time until the others showed up thananything else.        "Oh by the way,"  Rachel said, "Remindme to give you keys to get in here before youleave. That way you can let yourself in the nexttime you come over. I've got one for Penny tooand I've already given one to Pamela."        "Okay,"  Stephanie answered.        "But be sure to check and make sure thatmy name shows in the peephole plate on thedoor."  Rachel grinned mischievously.  "Cause ifits blank, it means that I've got company and youshould definitely knock first."        Stephanie had to laugh at the warning.Although living at home didn't afford her theprivacy to use such a system, she'd heard about itfrom her cousin who used something like it atcollege.        The laughter was cut short by the sound ofthe intercom buzzer.  Rachel got up and pressedthe speaker button.        "Food delivery."  came the voice from thespeaker which both women recognized as Penny's.        In reply, Rachel reached up and hit thebutton that unlocked the front door.        "Come on up."  she said.                She then went and opened up theapartment door,  waiting for their friends to comeup.        "I wonder why Pamela didn't use her key?"she said.  "I hope she didn't loose it already.        The reason turned out to be even simpler.When Penny got to the top floor, Pamela wasn'twith her.        "I hope someone is going to give me ahand with this,"  the smaller girl called out as sheindicated the three shopping bags she wasburdened down with.  "These aren't exactly light."           Rachel grabbed the largest bag, surprisedby its weight.  It was obvious that it containedmore than take out food.            "Where’s Pamela?"  Rachel asked as sheled the shorter girl into the apartment.           "There was some sort of problem at thestore,"  Penny said as she laid the two bags offood on the kitchen counter.  "She said for me togo along without her.  Said she should be alonglater, but looking at the way everyone wasrunning around the Office Bin, I doubt it."            "So I guess its just the three of us then."Rachel noted as she helped Penny empty the bags."And as usual you’ve brought enough food tofeed a half dozen."           "Well I just like to give everyone a goodvariety,"  Penny laughed.  "Besides, my Uncle wasjust going to have to toss it all if I didn’t take it."            "And some of us can eat like a horse andstill look like a sparrow."  Stephanie said from thecouch with a bit of envy in her voice.           "Oh hi, Stef,"  Penny said as she peeled offher brown leather bomber jacket.  "I didn’t seeyou at first."           "Story of my life."  Stephanie laughed asthey exchanged a brief hug.           True to her sometimes tomboy image,Penny was wearing jeans, sneakers and a shortsleeved corduroy shirt.  Stephanie wished shecould dress for work like that. Penny’s hair lookedlike it was cut even shorter than the last time she’dseen her.  Most woman couldn’t get away withhair like that, but on the short girl it certainlyworked.           "So what’s on the agenda for tonight?"  asked Penny.           "Well I guess some good food, a little wineand whatever’s on the TV."  Rachel replied. "With weather like this I think club hoppings outfor tonight.  So its just us girls."            "Unless you have a guy or two in thosebags."  Stephanie quipped.             Penny made a show of checking the twoempty shopping bags, then looked at her friendswith a disappointing look.            "I knew I forgot something,"  she laughed. "And Willoughby’s was running a special on cuteyoung guys tonight, too."            All three of them laughed at the joke asthey made up plates from the food Penny hadbrought.  Rachel took a cold bottle from therefrigerator and poured them each a glass of wineto go with the dinner.                Conversation over dinner made the mealthat much more enjoyable.  They had just aboutfinished when Stephanie noticed the last ofPenny’s packages still on the floor.             "So what’s with the other bag?" Stephanie asked as she ate.             "Oh I almost forgot,"  Penny replied withexcitement.  "Let me get it."        Dropping the bag on the center of thecountertop, Penny peeled it away to reveal a smallstatuette.  It was a semi-nude woman riding ahorse.  She was clad in battle armor and held asword and shield.  Engraved on the base was thetitle of the piece - Valkerie.         "It’s just a little apartment warming gift." Penny explained.  "When I saw it in the Sci Fi andFantasy shop I just fell in love with it."        "It’s beautiful,"  Rachel exclaimed.  "Iknow just the place for it."        With that, she picked it up and carried itover to the entertainment center.  A moment laterit occupied  a place of honor on it.        "Guess we should see what’s on the tube." Stephanie said, feeling a little bad that she hadn’tbrought a gift too.            "Might as well."  Rachel said as shepicked up the cable remote.  "Bring the wine inwith you."            As the girls settled in, each on their ownsection of the couch, Rachel tossed the remote toPenny who had sat to her right.            "Since you brought such a lovely gift, youget to pick what we watch."  she said.        "All right!"  Penny yelled.  "The ultimatepower -- control of the remote."                It quickly became apparent that even withover 80 channels, there wasn’t a great deal towatch -- at least not tonight.  Penny started withall the prime movie channels, HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, all showing films they had seen before.Next she tried some of the oldies channels, someof those classics were pretty good.  But theystruck out there as well.        "It helps if you stop at a channel for morethan 30 seconds."  Stephanie suggested with asmile.        "Okay rocket scientist, lets see you dobetter."  Penny grinned back as she tossed theremote across the couch.                "The secret,"  Stephanie said as sheclicked on the channel up button.  "Is not torandomly jump around the dial but to start at thebottom and work your way up."        Channel by channel flashed by -- akaleidoscope of entertainment ranging frommovies to game shows, how to shows to cookinghelp.        "This is entertaining,"  Penny said. "Maybewe should try a board game instead or maybe..."        The short black haired girl stopped inmid-sentence, her attention grabbed by the imagethat had just appeared on the large screen.        "Now that’s what I call entertainment!!" Penny cried out, pointing to the screen.        "Omigod, Rachel!"  Stephanie gasped asshe turned from the screen to her friend. "Whatare you doing with the porno channel?"        "Who cares?"  Penny interrupted.  "I likethis."        "Its not what you think,"  Rachel said.  "Ionly ordered basic cable.  Who has the money topay for all those premium channels?"        "And they all just appeared one day onyour TV,"  Stephanie laughed. "Like magic."        "Actually,..."  Stephanie hesitated for amoment.  "When the cable guy hooked this all up,he asked if I wanted all the stations."        "Yeah, right, you just smiled at him and hegave you all this."  Stephanie mocked with asmile.        "All right, he also asked me to dinner." she admitted.        "I bet I know what you had."  Penny laughed as she opened her mouth and slid herhand back and forth in front of it, as if she wereperforming oral sex.        "You know better than that, Penny." Rachel said in a sharp rebuke.        "Oh that’s right, I forgot."  the 20 year oldlied.  "You don’t do things like that."                Truth was, Rachel actually didn’t.  In theeight years of her sexual life, she’d performed oralsex on a guy a total of only two times.  Thesecond had only been to confirm the conclusionshe’d come to after the first:  namely that it wasn’tsomething she ever wanted to do again.         It didn’t make her a prude by any means,she was far from it.  When Rachel finally warmedup to a man enough to want him in her bed, shewas every guys dream: a woman who was warmand supportive in public -- and a wanton whore inthe bedroom.  The only problem was that mostguys didn’t make it to that level with her.  Mostusually lost interest when they learned she didn’tsuck cock.  The cute cable guy had been one ofthem.          "Maybe Rachel doesn’t,"  Stephanie noted,her eyes glued to the television.  "But that girlcertainly does."        The wide 35 inch screen was now filledwith the image of a large breasted blonde whowas giving quite a demonstration in the art offellatio.  The young man’s cock she hadswallowed practically whole was also quiteimpressive.        "She is good at it,"  Penny laughed.  "Maybe you should take notes, Rachel        Rachel made a disapproving face.        "Yeah, like that guys really that big!  I’llbet that’s as fake as that bimbo’s tits."        "Looks pretty real to me."  Penny said.        "Special effects,"  Rachel suggested. "Youcan’t tell me you’ve ever seen a guy that big forreal."        "I have ... "  Stephanie started to saywithout thinking, then caught herself."        It was a momentary slip of the tongue, buteach of the other girls caught it immediately.        "Tell, tell."  they both called out.  "Truthor Dare.  You know the rules."        It was a game they had played amongthemselves, a game of sexual secrets.  If any ofthem admitted to a sexual secret, they had to tellor take a dare.  The dares had sometimes been farworse than the truth.           "Come on Stef,"  Penny encouraged. "Truth or Dare?" she added with wicked emphasison the second choice."         Stephanie considered the possibleconsequences of a dare for a brief moment, thendecided on the truth.        "Robby McPherson."  she answered in alow voice.        "What was that?"  Rachel asked, cuppingher hand around her ear as if she was hard ofhearing.        "Robby McPherson!"  Stephanie repeatedin a louder voice.        "Robby McPherson!"  Penny also repeatedin an even louder voice.        "That computer geek who worked at themall last summer,"  Rachel chimed in. "ThatRobby McPherson?"               "Yes."  Stephanie responded simply.        "What the hell where you thinking?" Rachel asked.        "I can’t believe you dated that loser." Penny added when Stephanie didn’t reply.        "He was not a loser!"  Stephanie snappedback.  "And I didn’t date him ...  I fucked him! There I said it, are you happy." she added, takinga large drink from her wine glass.           "Shit, Stef, that’s even worse."  Rachelsaid.  "Why would you do a thing like that?"        In reply, Stephanie held up both hands andbrought them together until they stopped aboutnine inches apart.  Her meaning was obvious toher friends.  It was a gesture they’d use inreference to guys many times.  The only differencewas that this time it wasn’t a diminutive allusion.        "You’re shitting me."  Rachel said, eyeingthe gap between her hands.        "Honest truth."  Stephanie said, a termnone of them would ever lie about.        "Fuck!"  Rachel exclaimed.  "Who’d haveever thought it."                "Wait a minute,"  Penny cut them off. "Not so fast."        Stephanie and Rachel both turned to theirgirlfriend.        "Look, I’m willing to accept that maybeRobby McPherson, jerk that he might have been,is hung like a horse. And I’ll even admit that giventhe chance, anyone of us would’ve fucked himtoo.  But there is no way that you could’ve knownthat before you hopped into bed with him!"        "Actually, it was the back seat of his Dad’scar."  Stephanie grinned.  "And I did know, mybrother Jerry told me."        Both girls remembered Jerry Morgan hadalso worked at the mall last summer.  In fact, hehad been one of the few people who had beenfriends with Robby.        "How would Jerry know how big he was?" Rachel asked.  "And why would he tell you?"        "The same way I know Judy Peterman hasa large birthmark mole on her ass: the locker roomshowers."  Stephanie said.  "And as to the why, Iasked him once out of idle curiosity who had thebiggest cock in the mall."        "I still don’t buy it,"  Penny said.  "If mybrother asked me which girl in the shower had thebest boobs, I can’t imagine answering him.  And Idefinitely can’t imagine me asking him to checkout cocks for me -- or have him actually do it if Idid."                   "Well, maybe he would,"  Stephanieanswered with a devious smile on her face.  "Ifyou’d gotten him laid."        "You got him laid?"  Penny asked indisbelief.        "Well he thinks I got him laid," Stephanieadmitted.  "Actually all I did was introduce him toGloria Nelson."        "You got him laid," Rachel stated withauthority.  "All you had to do was introduce himto that teencock hungry bitch."                Gloria Nelson was a 37 year-old assistantmanager at the Oakdale Mall.  Twice divorced, itwas no secret among most of the women whoworked there that the redhead had a weakness forbarely legal boys.  Her various sexual escapadeswould have been enough to get her fired, if not forthe fact that her family was one of the mostprominent in town.          Unless one of her conquests turned out tobe underage -- she was always very careful aboutthat -- or one of the young men filed a complaint,even more unlikely after she had freely given themwhat they all would agree was one hot piece ofass -- Gloria would continue with her littleappetites.             "I guess that would be enough to get himto check out some cocks for you."  Penny finallyadmitted.         "To be honest, since that’s the nature ofthe game,"  Stephanie mused,  "I think most guys,Jerry included, do check the others out, to seehow they compare with each other.  They justdon’t want to admit they look at other guys."        "That’s probably true." both girls agreed,remembering secretly checking out classmates inthe showers back when they all started to develop.         "Now can we forget about all this andwatch the movie or something?"  Stephanie asked.            "Okay,"  Penny agreed.  "But I’m still madat you for one thing."        "What’s that?"  Stephanie asked somewhatconfused.        "You knew that twerp had a 9-inch cockand you didn’t tell any of the rest of us!"        All three of them burst into laughter asRachel refilled all their glasses.            For the next three quarters of an hour, thegirls watched the adult film, offering jokes andcomments about what they saw.  Also during thattime they finished off the first bottle of wine andworked their way halfway through a second.Rachel had also thrown a bag of popcorn into themicrowave. After all, what fun was a moviewithout popcorn?         The plot of the movie, such as there wasof one, was that of an adult television station trying to pick its new fall line-up.  A mixture ofmen and women sat in a boardroom, watchingshort clips of various pilots.  It was one such showthat the girls had already watched.  The clips wereshort on plot but long on sex.  As they went on,the members of the selection committee becamemore and more aroused.  A condition each of thegirls could sympathize with, even if they didn’twant to admit it.         The appearance of a small Asian womanon the screen brought immediate comments fromRachel and Stephanie that she resembled Penny, though in fact the multicultrual girl was differenteverywhere beyond Asian features and similarheight.        "I don’t look like that,"  Penny declared inmock protest, adding with a laugh,  "I have muchnicer tits."          It didn’t take long for the Asian actress tobecome involved with her male co-star.  In fact, ittook less than two minutes for these supposedlytotal strangers to get naked and go at it.  As theydid, Penny’s friends continued to remark at howmuch the girl on the screen really looked like her.        "I don’t know Penny,"  Stephanie musedas she watched the actress deep throat the manwho was as generously endowed as the actor inthe first clip.  "We’ve double dated and I have tosay, that sure looks like you."         "Yeah, are you sure you haven’t beenmoonlighting?"  Rachel chimed in.        "Why?"  Penny laughed.  "Are youjealous?"        Their friendly barbs continued as theon-screen couple continued their endeavors.  Theman climbed behind the girl and positioned hiscock against her ass.  With a loud grunt, hepushed his manhood inside her, accompanied bysqueals of encouragement from his partner.        "Ouch!"  Stephanie cried.  "That’s got tohurt!"        "Well, that proves that’s not me."  Pennygrimaced.  ‘This little ass is much too tight forsomething that big."  she quipped as she pattedher bottom.        "I don’t know,"  Rachel mused.  "I’veheard that if it’s done right it can be quite fun. After all, isn’t that what gay guys do?  There hasto be something pleasurable about it."        "Well when you find out, you can let therest of us know."  Stephanie retorted, wonderingif perhaps her friend had already tried it and didn’twant to admit it.                Another scene change brought an olderwoman in her forties to the screen, already ridingatop a young man who couldn’t be far out of histeens.  Almost immediately all three of them calledout the name of Gloria Nelson.  The fact that thiswoman was a brunette instead of a redheadmattered little.          "I guess that makes that your brother Jerrylaying underneath her."  Penny offered.        "No way,"  Stephanie retorted.  "Mybrother has a much better bod."        As one, Penny and Rachel snapped theirheads around to look in astonishment.        "Oh come on, you both have brothers." Stephanie added tartly. "You can’t tell me thatsomewhere along the line you haven’t gotten apeek at them, just like I’m sure they’ve gotten apeek at you."        Silence gave truth to her assertion.  It wasobvious that the wine, and the movie, were muchresponsible for her frankness.           Back on the screen, the Gloria Nelsonsurrogate was riding the younger man like a rodeorider atop a bull.  Her large unrestrained breastsbouncing in all directions.  The look of ecstasy onher face was a powerful enticement to the joys ofteenage boys.                "What do you think will happen first?" Penny asked.  "He pops his cork or that bedcollapses beneath them?"            "I’d say 50 - 50 either way."  Rachelanswered.        "I’ll go with his popping his cork," Stephanie bet. "That bed is stronger than it looks."        Less than an minute later, Stephanie wonthe bet as "Gloria" suddenly jumped off the youngman and spun around on the bed, her hand neverreleasing it’s grip on his hard cock.  Soon as thebrunette’s face reached his boyhood, it explodedin a shower of hot whiteness, covering her eagerlips and cheeks with his eruption.                The preview faded from view, to bereplaced by another scene.  It looked like thelocker room of the local high school.  From offcamera, the sound of running water could beheard from the showers.        "Anyone care to guess what kind of scenethis one is going to be?"  Penny asked, turning themovie into a sort of guessing game.        "My guess is the Quarterback andCheerleader."  Rachel said as she tossed half ahandful of popcorn into her mouth.        "Teacher and Student’s my guess." Stephanie said.        "I’m going to go with a gang bang." Penny offered with a wicked grin.        The Asian girl won that round as the starof the little epic, a tall statuesque blonde dressedin a very tight white uniform came into the lockerroom.  Evidently she was supposed to be theschool nurse.  She acted surprised when the soundof running water ceased and a half dozen nakedhunks walked into view.          In no time at all, the busty blonde waslaying on one of the benches, a stiff member ineach of her hands, a hard one in her mouth, afourth and fifth in her shaved pussy and tight ass. Standing just off to the right of the after-schoolorgy was the best looking of all the guys, playfullystroking the largest cock of the group and waitingfor an opening he could put it into.            "Guess she never heard of the idea thatyou can have too much of a good thing."  Rachelcommented.        "Maybe,"  Penny said.  "But I’d be glad totake care of the odd man out there."        "Get in line girl."  Stephanie cut in.                For so energetic a scene, it turned out tobe surprisingly short.  The odd man out never didfind his hole, but joined in with his buddies ingiving the nurse a cum shower.        "Well, so much for the idea that more isbetter."  Rachel said.        "Yeah, I think I prefer my sex one onone,"  Stephanie added.        "Me too,"  Penny chimed in.  "Well, maybetwo on one, but no more than that.  Except maybeon special occasions of course."                Rachel and Stephanie both laughed, notsure how much of Penny’s statement was intendedas a joke.         The scene shifted back to the boardroomwere several of the network executives were nowin various stages of undress, already engaged in sexual acts.  One of the female executives, a darkhaired thirty year old, was spread across the table,her dress up around her waist, her legs spreadwide.  Buried between those legs was the face of amale executive.  Kneeing beside that man was oneof the secretaries, her own mouth wrapped tightlyaround the cock sticking out from his threehundred dollar suit.          At the head of the table, the silver-grayhaired chairman of the board was also missing thelower half of his high priced suit, his own cockhowever was not as visible.  Instead it was buriedin the red-haired mound of the second secretarywho was being mounted doggie style by the seniorexecutive.          At the head of the room, the narrator ofthe film, who had also introducing the TV pilots,was trying to ignore the spectacle before him. Hecontinued to tell about the last show on theagenda.  It began to run on the monitor as thenarrator threw up his hand in surrender and pulledout his cock, sliding it into the mouth of theredhead.         The boardroom image faded, replaced bythe kitchen of a small apartment.  Standing at thecounter, her back to the camera, was a youngHispanic woman in her twenties.  Wearing a pairof cut off shorts and a red and white striped tanktop, she was pouring herself a cup of coffee.  Asshe turned to face the camera, a second cup became visible on the counter.  A smile crossed herlips as she tasted the steaming liquid.        Another figure then entered the kitchen, alight skinned brunette wearing a blue bathrobe.Her tousled short hair gave added evidence thatshe had just gotten out of bed. Pushing a lock ofloose hair away from her eyes, she accepted thesecond cup of coffee. In a brief chat the newarrival's name was revealed as Donna and thecoffee maker's as Modesta.         In no time at all, Donna’s robe fell opened,revealing a soft body accented by small curvingmounds, the pink nipples of which were both hardand visible.  The cup at her lips was quicklyreplaced by the equally hot lips of her companion.         With dazzling speed, the darker skinnedgirl traced a wet path down from the brunettes lipsto her breast. The nipple of which quicklydisappeared between her lips.         "Oh my!"  Stephanie gasped as shewatched the onscreen encounter advance to thenext stage.  She had crossed the room to pick upsome more muchies, but had stopped in mid stepat the sight.          In no time at all, Modesta's attentiondropped below her companion’s waist.  Stephaniehad seen women kiss each other on a few daringtelevision shows, had even seen them caress eachother’s breasts in an R rated film, but never hadshe seen a woman performing oral sex on anotherwoman.        The camera zoomed in, giving a close upview of Modesta’s tongue darting up and into thepink recesses of Donna’s pussy.  The picture wasso vivid that Stephanie could see the shiny layer ofnectar Modesta’s ministrations had produced.        ‘God, could you ever imagine doingsomething like that?"  Stephanie asked, her eyesnever leaving the screen.                It took a few long seconds for her torealize her friends hadn’t answered -- which shefound unusual.  She couldn’t ever remember thembeing at a loss for words!        "Could you ever imagine doing anythinglike that?"  she repeated, assuming they hadn’theard her.                The continued silence finally broke herfixation on the screen.  She turned her attentionback to Rachel.  The look on her girlfriend’s facewas akin to that of a kid who’d been caught witha hand in the cookie jar.                       "You’re kidding!"  Stephanie declared.        "Well, if you can be honest about RobbyMcPherson, then I should be honest too."  Rachel admitted.        "I don’t believe it,"  Stephanie said.  "Ithink now you’re putting me on.  Who have youever done it with?"                Rachel took a moment to think about heranswer.  Stephanie expected Rachel to say somedistant friend, if anything.  Instead the brunettelooked past the blond to the other end of the     couch.        Stephanie followed her line of sight, untilit stopped on an equally guilty face.        "Oh no, you had me going for a moment," Stephanie said, a touch of amusement in her tone."But now you’re stretching this a bit too far  --just a little bit over the top.  That was almost asgood as that story you had me believing aboutTracy Conway last month.                Tracy Conway was a somewhat masculinewoman in her thirties who also worked in the Mallat a sporting goods store.  One night, following afew hours of bar-hopping, the other girls hadconvinced Stephanie that Tracy was female as theresult of  a sex change operation.  It tookStephanie a week to discover it had been a joke.          Stephanie looked again at both of herfriends.  Neither one of them were laughing thistime.  Instead they shared a silent communication.        Without a word Penny got up from thecouch and walked past Stephanie. When shereached Rachel, the young Asian woman reachedup and gently stroked her cheek.  Then she pulledthe taller woman down to her level and kissed heron the lips.          It was a soft kiss at first, the kind that onefriend might give another, no different than someStephanie herself had gotten.  Then it becamemore and more erotic, a melding of lips and eagertongues.  Rachel responded in turn, pressing hardagainst the younger girl.        Stephanie was still trying to decide if thiswas a gag when Penny pushed the game evenfurther.  She slipped her hand up under Rachel’sT-shirt and fondled the naked flesh beneath it.         Breaking the kiss, she pulled up the thinmaterial and planted kisses on Rachel’s nowexposed breasts as well. Mimicking Modesta’sactions on the cable station, Penny slid her tongueunder Rachel’s erect nipple and guided it into hermouth.               "Shit,"  Stephanie finally exclaimed in arush of air. "This isn’t a joke."        With that, the two lovers ended theirembrace and faced their friend.  Their faces nowreflected a look of expectation.                Glancing back at the TV image, Stephanienoted that the two woman were now locked in a69 position, their mouths pressed tightly in eachother’s wet mounds.  What truly startled her wasthat, in her mind, instead of Donna and Modesta,the forms she now saw pressed together werethose of Rachel and Penny.                "Is it really as much fun as it looks?"  shewondered out loud.        In reply, she felt a soft hand come to reston her shoulder.           "We’d be happy to show you if you’rereally interested."  Rachel said.  "The only reasonwe never asked before is we weren’t sure of howyou’d react."        "Then why did you tell me now?" Stephanie asked.        "Honestly, I’m not sure,"  Stephanielaughed softly, trying to break the underlyingtension. "I didn’t plan it this way, it just seemedthe perfect time."        Stephanie thought about it for a briefmoment and decided that events had indeed madethis the perfect time.  The wine, the conversationthey’d been having had put them all at ease withwhat would normally have been a very awkwardsubject.        "And if  I thought that this wasn’t the sortof thing for me?"  Stephanie asked.        "Then I hope we’d just forget it all andstill be the same friends we all were 10 minutesago." Rachel replied.              Stephanie again looked past Rachel toPenny.  The younger girl hadn’t said a single wordsince Stephanie’s revelation.  She didn’t have to.The look in her eyes and on her face was amixture of apprehension and lust.        "Well I’ve always said,"  Stephanie said,placing her hand atop Rachel’s.  "You should tryeverything in life -- at least once."          She shifted her body ever so slightly, justenough to bring herself face to face with Rachel. Leaning forward, she pressed her lips against her.                It wasn’t the first time she had ever kissedRachel.  There had been many occasions when shekissed other girls, but never like this.  The touchof their lips now seemed electric.  A warmthspread throughout their bodies from that briefcontact.  The kiss was at the same time both briefand endless.          Still unsure of the situation, Rachel letStephanie take the lead.  It wasn’t until the blondkissed her a second time that Rachel began torespond.        Stephanie closed her eyes and the passionbuilding within her take control. She pushed hertongue into Rachel’s mouth, exploring thesoftness of it’s mirror image.        Rachel took hold of Stephanie’s hands andpressed them against her breasts. Tentatively, sheexplored the material covered mounds.  It was thefirst time she had ever felt the softness of aanother woman’s breast, the hardness of erectnipples.        As Stephanie continued to explore herfriends body, Rachel slid her own hands up anddown her friend’s back.  She took hold of thezipper of her dress and pulled it down, exposingthe flesh beneath it.  She caressed that flesh,running her nails across it.                The touch of a new hand caused Stephanieto open her eyes.  Penny now stood next to her aswell, a wide smile on her face.  Stephanie shiftedher attention to the youngest of her friends andkissed her too.  A kiss equal in intensity to thatshe had just given Rachel.  To Stephanie’s delight,the reaction she felt to it was also the same.        The three young women stood interlockedin the center of the room, kissing, exploring eachothers bodies, loosening clothing and searchingout the flesh beneath it.        "Maybe we should all just take a minuteand get comfortable."  Rachel suggestion.         The other’s nodded their agreement, andthey all took a few steps back from each other. Rachel was wearing the least so it took her only afew seconds to drop her shirt and panties to thefloor.  Standing naked in the center of the roomfor the second time that night, she took a momentto shut off the television. There was no longer anyneed for it, not when a much more interestingentertainment was about to commence.        Penny and Stephanie took only a littlelonger.  A small pile of clothes rested at eachgirl’s feet, topped by undergarments of variousdesigns.  Now they all stood naked, looking ateach other during an awkward pause.        Only a short time before, Stephanie hadfelt a little strange looking at Rachel’s nakedbody. Now she looked with a different eye.  All ofthem took a moment to look at each other.         Stephanie was surprised to see that Pennyhad shaved the hair between her legs.  She knewfrom brief glimpses that there never had beenmuch there to begin with.  But the absence of thatlittle bit made the small girl seem even more like ateenager. Rachel on the other hand, had a widepatch of dark brown hair.  Stephanie’s own bushwas somewhere between the two extremes and alight blond.        Even their breasts formed a sharp contrast, not just in size, ranging from Rachel’s 38C toPenny’s 34B, but in the very shape of them. Stephanie’s were very rounded with wide pinkcircles around short pink nipples.  Rachel’smounds were conical in nature with puffy areolasthat stuck out even further.  Penny had the darkestnipples of the three, a rich dark brown againstbutternut skin.                  "So now what?"  Stephanie asked as shetossed her hands up in the air.        "Why don’t you make yourselfcomfortable on the couch," Rachel suggested witha smile.  "and let us take care of getting thingsstarted."        Thinking it not a bad suggestion at all,Stephanie sat down on the center of the widecouch.  Rachel and Penny sat down beside her,tossing the larger throw pillows onto thehardwood floor.  They would come in handy later.        Penny kissed Stephanie.  Then Rachelkissed Stephanie.  Then, leaning across the middlegirl, Penny kissed Rachel.  As they did, they eachcupped the closest of Stephanie’s breasts, playingtheir fingers across her nipples - enjoying thestiffness found there.        Stephanie couldn’t help but compare thetouch of the two women to that of men she’dknown.  For the most part, it was softer -- yet atthe same time much more erotic.  As were the sensations it produced.  Even more pleasing werethe waves of delight that filled her breasts whenthose skillful fingers where replaced with evenmore talented mouths.         Matching tongues traced a path acrosssupple flesh, until they met in the rich valleybetween the mounds.  There the two lovers kissedonce more before parting in different directions.         Penny continued to kiss and caressStephanie’s breasts, alternating between softtouches and gentle bites.  Working her way backto Stephanie’s willing mouth, she pressed herdarker breasts hard against the those of the girlbeneath her. The nipple to nipple contact wasenough to elicit a soft moan from Stephanie.  Amoan cut short by the crush of Penny’s mouth.        Rachel had moved her attentions lower,dropping down to sit on one of the oversizedcushions.  With a hand on each of Stef’s thighs,she spread them apart to expose the blond-framedpearl.        Burying her head between the pale legs,Rachel ran her tongue along the length of herfriend’s womanhood -- her heart racing withexcitement at the idea that she was the firstwoman ever to do so.  The scent of Stephanie’salready damp mound was intoxicating, a feastwaiting to be savored.         Not to be denied, she drove her tongue upbetween the folds of those sugar walls, clearing apath to the clitoris.  A path quickly followed.        "Oh God!!"  Stephanie gasped as she feltRachel’s tongue strike her like the spark to amatch.  It was enough for her to momentaryforget the girl still playing with both her breastsand mouth.          But only for a moment as Penny liftedherself higher and guided one of her own richmounds to Stephanie’s lips.  Her mouth still openfrom her gasp, Penny pushed her erect nipplebetween the blonde’s red lips.        There had often been times whenStephanie had often wondered what it might feellike to suck on a woman’s breasts.  Her ownmounds were too small to try it on herself.  She’dincluded sucking on a man’s nipples as part of herloveplay, but she was sure it wasn’t the same.        Now with the reality between her teeth,she knew that her earlier conclusion was right. Playing with a man’s nipples was nothing like thereal thing of a woman.  She could taste Penny in away that she never could a man, delighting in themixture of soft and hard.  She ran her tongue backand forth across the dark, pert tips, trying torepeat the pleasing affect that Penny had producedin her.           As the now saturated nipple slipped fromher lips, Penny wrapped her hands around theback of Stephanie’s head, guiding her face to thesoft spot between her breasts, inviting her to feastthere as well, an invitation Stephanie was all toowilling to accept.  She licked her way across thedamp skin, enjoying the heady aroma filling hernostrils. Then with girlish delight she repeated herperformance on Penny’s other mound.        Her interest still fixed on Stephanie’spussy, Rachel slid one finger, then another deepwithin it.  The initial wetness she found there increased as she moved her fingers back and forth. With their motion waves of enchantmentexpanded to fill Stephanie’s relaxed form.        Rachel augmented the touch of her fingerswith that of her tongue, reaching her friend’s mostsensitive spots as if they were familiar as her own. In truth many of them were identical.          If Stephanie had time to think about it --which her two friends were definitely not allowing-- she might have appreciated the irony of thesituation.  Rachel, who cringed at the thought oftaking a man in her mouth, had no such hesitationwhere another woman was involved.        "This feels so fucking good!"  Stephaniemoaned as she laid back and enjoyed thetwo-pronged assault on her body.  "I don’t thinkI’ve ever felt this fantastic."         As Penny climbed off Stephanie, Rachelalso moved back.  Together they guided theirneophyte lover onto the large pillows they hadearlier tossed to the floor.  As soon as Stephanielaid across the pillows, Rachel again spread herlegs and went right back to where she left off.        Penny had other ideas.  It was timeStephanie learned how to give as well as receive.Squatting over Stephanie’s face, Penny droppeddown until her pussy was only a few inches aboveit.        Prior to this moment, Stephanie had neverseen another woman’s sex close up.  The fact thatPenny’s was totally hairless gave it an even moreinteresting perspective.  The first thing she noticedwas that for such a small girl, Penny had anunusually large clitoris. It was almost like a tinypenis.         No imagination was needed for Stephanieto figure out what Penny wanted. Unlike Rachel,Stephanie never had a problem with oral sex, sowith virginal enthusiasm, she reached out with hertongue and ran it across Penny’s erect clit.        "Oh yeah baby,"  Penny panted.  "Go forit!"        Go for it Stephanie did, pulling Penny’sclit between her lips, massaging it with hertongue.  Then she swept it back across the lengthof Penny’s pussy, savoring her first taste of awoman.          The scent of Penny's sex was almostoverpowering, and to her delight she learned withher first lick that the taste was all she hoped itwould be.  Penny lowered her pelvis further sothat Stephanie could have easier access to her wetcunt.          Slowly at first, Stephanie licked theyounger girl, exploring her womanhood.  Thenshe began to quicken the pace until she reached arhythm that sent little ripples throughout Penny'sbody.          Ripples that mirrored those fillingStephanie's body as Rachel continued to workmagic between her legs.  As one hand continuedto slide outstretched fingers up and down theblond framed love canal, the brunette’s other handworked the same enchantment on her own -- withmuch the same results.        Faster and faster all three of them went,plunging down the well of ecstasy.  It was a raceto rapture - a pursuit each wanted to win.          To her surprise, Stephanie produced thefirst orgasm as Penny’s body suddenly convulsedagainst her mouth and it filled with a blast ofhoney.  It was such a sexual rush that it sentStephanie’s own body over the edge, showering Rachel with the same gift.  A reward she hungrilyaccepted.        Finally, Rachel joined the chorus, meremoments behind the others, propelled by thesymphony of her fingers                  "Oh my god!"  Stephanie exclaimed asthey laid naked on the floor, still entwined in eachother’s bodies.  "I can’t believe how intense thatwas.  How did you ever get the idea to trysomething like this ... and how long have you beendoing it?"                "Well it was originally Penny’s idea." Rachel replied, running her hand alongsidePenny’s cheek.  "And we’ve been doing it, as youcall it, for the last six months."        Stephanie turned to Penny, but before shecould ask the question on her lips, Pennyanswered it with a laugh.        "I’ve been doing it since I was 16. Whatcan I say?  I’ve always been an advanced learner."                 The other two girls joined in the laughteras they continued to stroke and kiss each other. They all knew what had just happened was onlythe beginning.  There would be many more littleadventures in their collective future.                "Err ... Rachel,"  Stephanie suddenly askedseriously.  "Remember what you said earliertonight about the nameplate on the door?"        "Of course,"  Rachel answered, wonderingwhy Stephanie was suddenly concerned aboutsomething so mundane.        "I think you might want to try andremember that a little harder in the future." Stephanie continued.                "Oh shit!" Penny cried out abruptly, cutting off any further inquiry Rachel might havehad about Stephanie’s sudden tangent.                Rachel followed Penny’s gaze until allthree of them were looking at the front doorway. An entrance now filled by the tall figure of a darkskinned young woman in a bright red raincoat,holding a silver keychain in her hand.                "Fuck!"  Rachel blurted out," "Pamela!"        They all sat silent after that for longseconds,  like statues in some far off garden.                "Looks like I missed one hell of a party." Pamela said as she pulled off her raincoat anddraped it over a wall hook, revealing a bluebusiness suit.  "And here I thought I knew whatkind of people my friends were." she said in a hurttone.                 "Oh fuck!"  Rachel repeated.  The othertwo girls were still too stunned to say anythingelse.                "I am disappointed in you all,"  Pameladeclared as she stepped into the room and stoodover the naked trio.  "I thought we were supposedto be the Four Musketeers!"                It took a few seconds for them to realizethat the oldest of their little group wasn’t reallyangry or shocked at all. In fact, it was nowbecoming obvious that she hadn’t just walked ineither. How long she’d been watching was anquestion unasked -- at least for now.          With smiles now filling their faces, allthree girls reached up and pulled Pamela downinto the center of their circle.  She seemed a littleout of place with her conservative attire, butwithin a few minutes that was gone as well.  Herdark form was soon covered by an intermix oflighter hues.                Hours later, long after the rain hadstopped and the night once more grew quiet, thesounds of passion could still be heard.  Thequartet truly learned the meaning of their motto. One for all, and all for one.    END #*#One For AllOne For All ...by Ann Douglas#*#        Stepping into the building vestibule,Stephanie Morgan shook the water from herumbrella. It had only been a little over two blockwalk from the bus stop, but she had gotten soakednevertheless. Opening her raincoat, the 24 yearold blond made an attempt to shake that dry aswell.        It had been bad luck that her brotherJerry’s car had picked tonight of all nights not tostart up.  He had promised to drop her off at herfriend Rachel’s new apartment. No matter, shereluctantly concluded, at least she was here now.        "Lets see,"  she mused as she ran herfinger across the row of intercom buttons."Alexander ... Markham ... Ford ...  here it is,Lieberman, 5B"        It took a few moments to get a response,then a semi-distorted voice filtered through thespeaker.        "Hello?"  the female voice asked.        "Rachel, it’s me Stef."  she replied.        "Come on up," Rachel said as the buzzersounded and the inner door unlocked.  "I’m in theshower."          "She’s in the shower?"  Stephanie laughedas she glanced back out into the rain coveredstreet.         As she walked up the stairs to the fifthfloor apartment, Stephanie couldn’t help but envyher girlfriends new accommodations.  To someonestill living at home, the small apartment complexmight has well been a palace. There was no waythe salesgirl could afford a place like this on hersalary.          Of course Rachel really couldn’t afford aplace like this on her salary either.  The buildingwas owned by Martin Lieberman, who whenasked by his widowed sister-in-law to help herdaughter find an apartment was more than happyto find her this one.  It was a small thing to makea woman he’d admired for years happy.  Besides,having his niece living here assured him a honestpair of eyes to watch over his investment.         Reaching the fifth floor of the smallapartment building, Stephanie found that therewere some limits to Mr. Lieberman's generosityafter all.  Apartment 5B was a small studioapartment, one of three on the top floor.  Tryingthe door, she found it unlocked and steppedinside.        "Rachel," the blue eyed blond called out asshe closed the door behind her.        "I'm in here, Stef," came a reply from the bathroom, a voice much more recognizable thanthe one that had come over the intercom.  "Makeyourself comfortable and  I'll be out in a fewminutes."            Hanging her coat, on the rack by the door,Stephanie checked the short red dress she waswearing.  It was a little damp but otherwise okay.She had gotten home late and didn’t have time tochange clothes.          As she waited, Stephanie took in hersurroundings.  The apartment might be small, butit had a certain charm.  The first feature shenoticed were large twin skylights in the ceiling. The soft patter of rain could be heard againstthem.  On a clear day or night, they would give anice natural light to the room.        On the far left, a large bay window alsoadded to the natural light.  The view beyond itwas nothing special, but it was a nice feature.  A kitchenette over by the bathroom entranceconsisted of a small refrigerator, a stovetop and microwave. And of course a kitchen sink.        There really wasn't much in the way ofdecoration on the walls, but then Rachel had onlybeen living there a few weeks.  The center of theroom was dominated by a large green oversizedU-shaped sofa.  In addition to the deep cushions,it was covered with equally push and oversizedpillows.  Rachel had mentioned to her that sheused the sofa in place of a bed.        At the open end of the couch was one ofthose small self assembly entertainment centers, the bottom of  which was filled with her friend'sold stereo system . What was new was the large35-inch color television, a housewarming gift fromRachel's grandmother.  The couch had been onefrom her mother.        On both sides of the television were someframed photographs.  One brought a smile toStephanie’s face. The 5 x 7 picture was veryfamiliar to the 24 year old.  A smaller version wasstuck in the mirror frame in her own bedroom. The picture had been taken last summer at theOakdale Mall Talent Show.        Centered in the picture was Rachel ofcourse.  She always had to be the center ofattention.  To her right was Stephanie herself.That was when her hair had been down toher shoulders, rather than the short curly look shenow wore.        To Rachel's left was a much smaller girl,whose mixed Philippine, Chinese and Spanishheritage had given her a soft brown complexion. Her very short black hair and unisex featuresgave her an androgynous look.  In fact, if it wasn'tfor the small mounds protruding from her chest,she might've been mistaken for a teenage boy. Her name was Annie Liu, but everyone called herPenny.  Despite her teenage looks, she was 20years old.        The last member of the quartet was a tallblack woman standing just behind and to theleft of Rachel. Five foot ten, she stood half a headtaller than any of the others, more than that inthe case of Penny's five two. Her skin was ebonyblack, a sharp contrast to both Rachel andStephanie.  Most men first noticed her somewhatample bust.  In the case of women it was her jetblack hair which she usually wore in an elaboratedesign.  At 26, Pamela Wilson was the oldestmember of their little band.        All four women worked at the OakdaleMall. Rachel was a medical assistant.  Stephaniewas a sales representative at one of the large department stores.  Penny worked at her unclesrestaurant. She was also a college student. Pamela was the associate manager of  an officesupply store.        Despite their differences in ages andbackgrounds, they had all become friends overcountless shared lunches.  Soon their friendshipshad extended beyond work.  The picture hadcaptured one of the highlights of that friendship. Billing themselves as the Four Musketeers, sonamed because those were the only costumes theycould find, they had entered the talent showas a singing group.  It was more fun than hardwork and the money went to charity.  To theirsurprise, they finished in second place.  Since thenthey still jokingly referred to themselves as theFour Musketeers.        "We'd have gotten first,"  Stephaniethought as she replaced the picture on theentertainment center. "If we paraded around halfnaked like Judy Peterman.  The judges weremore impressed by her big nipples stickingthrough her blouse than her singing."        "Any sign of the rain letting up?"  Rachelasked as she walked out of the bathroom.        "No, it looks like tonight’s a totalwashout."  Stephanie replied as she turned aroundat the sound of her voice.        "A pity."  Rachel commented as shewalked over to Stephanie and kissed her on thecheek as a friendly hello.        Covered only by a large bath towel thatshe had wrapped around herself, Rachel walkedover to a large dresser that lined the far wall, stilldrying her hair as she walked.        "It really sucks that it had to rain tonight" Rachel said , pulling a pair of panties and anoversized T-shirt from the top drawer.  "I waslooking forward to that concert."        The original plan for the evening was for agirls night out.  One of their favorite local bandswas holding an open air concert in Marshall Park.They'd planned to take dinner a couple of blanketsand a few bottles of wine out to enjoy the music. Unfortunately Mother Nature had other ideas.  Sorather than let the night go to waste, they haddecided to have a girl's night in instead.        "Penny and Pamela are picking up thefood." Rachel said as she unwrapped the towelfrom around her and let it fall to the floor.  "I'mnot sure what they're getting, but knowing Pamelait's sure to be something interesting." she added asshe stood there nude as the day she was born.        "I guess so." Stephanie replied in anstrained tone.        Silly as she knew it was, Stephanie felt it alittle strange for her friend to be standing nude infront of her as they continued their conversation. It wasn't of course the first time she'd seen Rachelnaked.  They'd gone to the beach many times, aswell as clothes shopping both together and as partof the group.  They'd shared dressing rooms manytimes, but somehow it now seemed different --somewhat out of context maybe, standing nakedin the living room.  Then she reminded herself thatthis was also Rachel's bedroom, a place where itwas perfectly natural for her to be nude.        Stephanie also considered that she feltuncomfortable because when they'd first met,Rachel and she had almost the same physicalbuild, the main difference being Rachel's darkerbrown hair and slightly larger breasts.  Thatdifference had grown to more than a few poundsof extra weight on Stephanie. Despite assurancesfrom many of her friends that she looked betterwith the extra weight, which was still within thenorm for her size, she always felt self-consciousabout it. It was an outgrowth of her teen yearswhen she had actually been overweight.        It didn't take Rachel long to put on thepair of panties and the T-shirt she had taken out.Since she was home and not planning to go out,she didn't see the need for anything more.  Withher breasts still a little damp, Rachel's much darkernipples clearly showed through the thin cotton.        "Judy Peterman would’ve been  proud." Stephanie thought with a laugh as her discomfortpassed.        Fifteen minutes passed as the two of themsat on the couch and chatted. They had seeneach other that morning so it was more a matterof killing time until the others showed up thananything else.        "Oh by the way,"  Rachel said, "Remindme to give you keys to get in here before youleave. That way you can let yourself in the nexttime you come over. I've got one for Penny tooand I've already given one to Pamela."        "Okay,"  Stephanie answered.        "But be sure to check and make sure thatmy name shows in the peephole plate on thedoor."  Rachel grinned mischievously.  "Cause ifits blank, it means that I've got company and youshould definitely knock first."        Stephanie had to laugh at the warning.Although living at home didn't afford her theprivacy to use such a system, she'd heard about itfrom her cousin who used something like it atcollege.        The laughter was cut short by the sound ofthe intercom buzzer.  Rachel got up and pressedthe speaker button.        "Food delivery."  came the voice from thespeaker which both women recognized as Penny's.        In reply, Rachel reached up and hit thebutton that unlocked the front door.        "Come on up."  she said.                She then went and opened up theapartment door,  waiting for their friends to comeup.        "I wonder why Pamela didn't use her key?"she said.  "I hope she didn't loose it already.        The reason turned out to be even simpler.When Penny got to the top floor, Pamela wasn'twith her.        "I hope someone is going to give me ahand with this,"  the smaller girl called out as sheindicated the three shopping bags she wasburdened down with.  "These aren't exactly light."           Rachel grabbed the largest bag, surprisedby its weight.  It was obvious that it containedmore than take out food.            "Where’s Pamela?"  Rachel asked as sheled the shorter girl into the apartment.           "There was some sort of problem at thestore,"  Penny said as she laid the two bags offood on the kitchen counter.  "She said for me togo along without her.  Said she should be alonglater, but looking at the way everyone wasrunning around the Office Bin, I doubt it."            "So I guess its just the three of us then."Rachel noted as she helped Penny empty the bags."And as usual you’ve brought enough food tofeed a half dozen."           "Well I just like to give everyone a goodvariety,"  Penny laughed.  "Besides, my Uncle wasjust going to have to toss it all if I didn’t take it."            "And some of us can eat like a horse andstill look like a sparrow."  Stephanie said from thecouch with a bit of envy in her voice.           "Oh hi, Stef,"  Penny said as she peeled offher brown leather bomber jacket.  "I didn’t seeyou at first."           "Story of my life."  Stephanie laughed asthey exchanged a brief hug.           True to her sometimes tomboy image,Penny was wearing jeans, sneakers and a shortsleeved corduroy shirt.  Stephanie wished shecould dress for work like that. Penny’s hair lookedlike it was cut even shorter than the last time she’dseen her.  Most woman couldn’t get away withhair like that, but on the short girl it certainlyworked.           "So what’s on the agenda for tonight?"  asked Penny.           "Well I guess some good food, a little wineand whatever’s on the TV."  Rachel replied. "With weather like this I think club hoppings outfor tonight.  So its just us girls."            "Unless you have a guy or two in thosebags."  Stephanie quipped.             Penny made a show of checking the twoempty shopping bags, then looked at her friendswith a disappointing look.            "I knew I forgot something,"  she laughed. "And Willoughby’s was running a special on cuteyoung guys tonight, too."            All three of them laughed at the joke asthey made up plates from the food Penny hadbrought.  Rachel took a cold bottle from therefrigerator and poured them each a glass of wineto go with the dinner.                Conversation over dinner made the mealthat much more enjoyable.  They had just aboutfinished when Stephanie noticed the last ofPenny’s packages still on the floor.             "So what’s with the other bag?" Stephanie asked as she ate.             "Oh I almost forgot,"  Penny replied withexcitement.  "Let me get it."        Dropping the bag on the center of thecountertop, Penny peeled it away to reveal a smallstatuette.  It was a semi-nude woman riding ahorse.  She was clad in battle armor and held asword and shield.  Engraved on the base was thetitle of the piece - Valkerie.         "It’s just a little apartment warming gift." Penny explained.  "When I saw it in the Sci Fi andFantasy shop I just fell in love with it."        "It’s beautiful,"  Rachel exclaimed.  "Iknow just the place for it."        With that, she picked it up and carried itover to the entertainment center.  A moment laterit occupied  a place of honor on it.        "Guess we should see what’s on the tube." Stephanie said, feeling a little bad that she hadn’tbrought a gift too.            "Might as well."  Rachel said as shepicked up the cable remote.  "Bring the wine inwith you."            As the girls settled in, each on their ownsection of the couch, Rachel tossed the remote toPenny who had sat to her right.            "Since you brought such a lovely gift, youget to pick what we watch."  she said.        "All right!"  Penny yelled.  "The ultimatepower -- control of the remote."                It quickly became apparent that even withover 80 channels, there wasn’t a great deal towatch -- at least not tonight.  Penny started withall the prime movie channels, HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, all showing films they had seen before.Next she tried some of the oldies channels, someof those classics were pretty good.  But theystruck out there as well.        "It helps if you stop at a channel for morethan 30 seconds."  Stephanie suggested with asmile.        "Okay rocket scientist, lets see you dobetter."  Penny grinned back as she tossed theremote across the couch.                "The secret,"  Stephanie said as sheclicked on the channel up button.  "Is not torandomly jump around the dial but to start at thebottom and work your way up."        Channel by channel flashed by -- akaleidoscope of entertainment ranging frommovies to game shows, how to shows to cookinghelp.        "This is entertaining,"  Penny said. "Maybewe should try a board game instead or maybe..."        The short black haired girl stopped inmid-sentence, her attention grabbed by the imagethat had just appeared on the large screen.        "Now that’s what I call entertainment!!" Penny cried out, pointing to the screen.        "Omigod, Rachel!"  Stephanie gasped asshe turned from the screen to her friend. "Whatare you doing with the porno channel?"        "Who cares?"  Penny interrupted.  "I likethis."        "Its not what you think,"  Rachel said.  "Ionly ordered basic cable.  Who has the money topay for all those premium channels?"        "And they all just appeared one day onyour TV,"  Stephanie laughed. "Like magic."        "Actually,..."  Stephanie hesitated for amoment.  "When the cable guy hooked this all up,he asked if I wanted all the stations."        "Yeah, right, you just smiled at him and hegave you all this."  Stephanie mocked with asmile.        "All right, he also asked me to dinner." she admitted.        "I bet I know what you had."  Penny laughed as she opened her mouth and slid herhand back and forth in front of it, as if she wereperforming oral sex.        "You know better than that, Penny." Rachel said in a sharp rebuke.        "Oh that’s right, I forgot."  the 20 year oldlied.  "You don’t do things like that."                Truth was, Rachel actually didn’t.  In theeight years of her sexual life, she’d performed oralsex on a guy a total of only two times.  Thesecond had only been to confirm the conclusionshe’d come to after the first:  namely that it wasn’tsomething she ever wanted to do again.         It didn’t make her a prude by any means,she was far from it.  When Rachel finally warmedup to a man enough to want him in her bed, shewas every guys dream: a woman who was warmand supportive in public -- and a wanton whore inthe bedroom.  The only problem was that mostguys didn’t make it to that level with her.  Mostusually lost interest when they learned she didn’tsuck cock.  The cute cable guy had been one ofthem.          "Maybe Rachel doesn’t,"  Stephanie noted,her eyes glued to the television.  "But that girlcertainly does."        The wide 35 inch screen was now filledwith the image of a large breasted blonde whowas giving quite a demonstration in the art offellatio.  The young man’s cock she hadswallowed practically whole was also quiteimpressive.        "She is good at it,"  Penny laughed.  "Maybe you should take notes, Rachel        Rachel made a disapproving face.        "Yeah, like that guys really that big!  I’llbet that’s as fake as that bimbo’s tits."        "Looks pretty real to me."  Penny said.        "Special effects,"  Rachel suggested. "Youcan’t tell me you’ve ever seen a guy that big forreal."        "I have ... "  Stephanie started to saywithout thinking, then caught herself."        It was a momentary slip of the tongue, buteach of the other girls caught it immediately.        "Tell, tell."  they both called out.  "Truthor Dare.  You know the rules."        It was a game they had played amongthemselves, a game of sexual secrets.  If any ofthem admitted to a sexual secret, they had to tellor take a dare.  The dares had sometimes been farworse than the truth.           "Come on Stef,"  Penny encouraged. "Truth or Dare?" she added with wicked emphasison the second choice."         Stephanie considered the possibleconsequences of a dare for a brief moment, thendecided on the truth.        "Robby McPherson."  she answered in alow voice.        "What was that?"  Rachel asked, cuppingher hand around her ear as if she was hard ofhearing.        "Robby McPherson!"  Stephanie repeatedin a louder voice.        "Robby McPherson!"  Penny also repeatedin an even louder voice.        "That computer geek who worked at themall last summer,"  Rachel chimed in. "ThatRobby McPherson?"               "Yes."  Stephanie responded simply.        "What the hell where you thinking?" Rachel asked.        "I can’t believe you dated that loser." Penny added when Stephanie didn’t reply.        "He was not a loser!"  Stephanie snappedback.  "And I didn’t date him ...  I fucked him! There I said it, are you happy." she added, takinga large drink from her wine glass.           "Shit, Stef, that’s even worse."  Rachelsaid.  "Why would you do a thing like that?"        In reply, Stephanie held up both hands andbrought them together until they stopped aboutnine inches apart.  Her meaning was obvious toher friends.  It was a gesture they’d use inreference to guys many times.  The only differencewas that this time it wasn’t a diminutive allusion.        "You’re shitting me."  Rachel said, eyeingthe gap between her hands.        "Honest truth."  Stephanie said, a termnone of them would ever lie about.        "Fuck!"  Rachel exclaimed.  "Who’d haveever thought it."                "Wait a minute,"  Penny cut them off. "Not so fast."        Stephanie and Rachel both turned to theirgirlfriend.        "Look, I’m willing to accept that maybeRobby McPherson, jerk that he might have been,is hung like a horse. And I’ll even admit that giventhe chance, anyone of us would’ve fucked himtoo.  But there is no way that you could’ve knownthat before you hopped into bed with him!"        "Actually, it was the back seat of his Dad’scar."  Stephanie grinned.  "And I did know, mybrother Jerry told me."        Both girls remembered Jerry Morgan hadalso worked at the mall last summer.  In fact, hehad been one of the few people who had beenfriends with Robby.        "How would Jerry know how big he was?" Rachel asked.  "And why would he tell you?"        "The same way I know Judy Peterman hasa large birthmark mole on her ass: the locker roomshowers."  Stephanie said.  "And as to the why, Iasked him once out of idle curiosity who had thebiggest cock in the mall."        "I still don’t buy it,"  Penny said.  "If mybrother asked me which girl in the shower had thebest boobs, I can’t imagine answering him.  And Idefinitely can’t imagine me asking him to checkout cocks for me -- or have him actually do it if Idid."                   "Well, maybe he would,"  Stephanieanswered with a devious smile on her face.  "Ifyou’d gotten him laid."        "You got him laid?"  Penny asked indisbelief.        "Well he thinks I got him laid," Stephanieadmitted.  "Actually all I did was introduce him toGloria Nelson."        "You got him laid," Rachel stated withauthority.  "All you had to do was introduce himto that teencock hungry bitch."                Gloria Nelson was a 37 year-old assistantmanager at the Oakdale Mall.  Twice divorced, itwas no secret among most of the women whoworked there that the redhead had a weakness forbarely legal boys.  Her various sexual escapadeswould have been enough to get her fired, if not forthe fact that her family was one of the mostprominent in town.          Unless one of her conquests turned out tobe underage -- she was always very careful aboutthat -- or one of the young men filed a complaint,even more unlikely after she had freely given themwhat they all would agree was one hot piece ofass -- Gloria would continue with her littleappetites.             "I guess that would be enough to get himto check out some cocks for you."  Penny finallyadmitted.         "To be honest, since that’s the nature ofthe game,"  Stephanie mused,  "I think most guys,Jerry included, do check the others out, to seehow they compare with each other.  They justdon’t want to admit they look at other guys."        "That’s probably true." both girls agreed,remembering secretly checking out classmates inthe showers back when they all started to develop.         "Now can we forget about all this andwatch the movie or something?"  Stephanie asked.            "Okay,"  Penny agreed.  "But I’m still madat you for one thing."        "What’s that?"  Stephanie asked somewhatconfused.        "You knew that twerp had a 9-inch cockand you didn’t tell any of the rest of us!"        All three of them burst into laughter asRachel refilled all their glasses.            For the next three quarters of an hour, thegirls watched the adult film, offering jokes andcomments about what they saw.  Also during thattime they finished off the first bottle of wine andworked their way halfway through a second.Rachel had also thrown a bag of popcorn into themicrowave. After all, what fun was a moviewithout popcorn?         The plot of the movie, such as there wasof one, was that of an adult television station trying to pick its new fall line-up.  A mixture ofmen and women sat in a boardroom, watchingshort clips of various pilots.  It was one such showthat the girls had already watched.  The clips wereshort on plot but long on sex.  As they went on,the members of the selection committee becamemore and more aroused.  A condition each of thegirls could sympathize with, even if they didn’twant to admit it.         The appearance of a small Asian womanon the screen brought immediate comments fromRachel and Stephanie that she resembled Penny, though in fact the multicultrual girl was differenteverywhere beyond Asian features and similarheight.        "I don’t look like that,"  Penny declared inmock protest, adding with a laugh,  "I have muchnicer tits."          It didn’t take long for the Asian actress tobecome involved with her male co-star.  In fact, ittook less than two minutes for these supposedlytotal strangers to get naked and go at it.  As theydid, Penny’s friends continued to remark at howmuch the girl on the screen really looked like her.        "I don’t know Penny,"  Stephanie musedas she watched the actress deep throat the manwho was as generously endowed as the actor inthe first clip.  "We’ve double dated and I have tosay, that sure looks like you."         "Yeah, are you sure you haven’t beenmoonlighting?"  Rachel chimed in.        "Why?"  Penny laughed.  "Are youjealous?"        Their friendly barbs continued as theon-screen couple continued their endeavors.  Theman climbed behind the girl and positioned hiscock against her ass.  With a loud grunt, hepushed his manhood inside her, accompanied bysqueals of encouragement from his partner.        "Ouch!"  Stephanie cried.  "That’s got tohurt!"        "Well, that proves that’s not me."  Pennygrimaced.  ‘This little ass is much too tight forsomething that big."  she quipped as she pattedher bottom.        "I don’t know,"  Rachel mused.  "I’veheard that if it’s done right it can be quite fun. After all, isn’t that what gay guys do?  There hasto be something pleasurable about it."        "Well when you find out, you can let therest of us know."  Stephanie retorted, wonderingif perhaps her friend had already tried it and didn’twant to admit it.                Another scene change brought an olderwoman in her forties to the screen, already ridingatop a young man who couldn’t be far out of histeens.  Almost immediately all three of them calledout the name of Gloria Nelson.  The fact that thiswoman was a brunette instead of a redheadmattered little.          "I guess that makes that your brother Jerrylaying underneath her."  Penny offered.        "No way,"  Stephanie retorted.  "Mybrother has a much better bod."        As one, Penny and Rachel snapped theirheads around to look in astonishment.        "Oh come on, you both have brothers." Stephanie added tartly. "You can’t tell me thatsomewhere along the line you haven’t gotten apeek at them, just like I’m sure they’ve gotten apeek at you."        Silence gave truth to her assertion.  It wasobvious that the wine, and the movie, were muchresponsible for her frankness.           Back on the screen, the Gloria Nelsonsurrogate was riding the younger man like a rodeorider atop a bull.  Her large unrestrained breastsbouncing in all directions.  The look of ecstasy onher face was a powerful enticement to the joys ofteenage boys.                "What do you think will happen first?" Penny asked.  "He pops his cork or that bedcollapses beneath them?"            "I’d say 50 - 50 either way."  Rachelanswered.        "I’ll go with his popping his cork," Stephanie bet. "That bed is stronger than it looks."        Less than an minute later, Stephanie wonthe bet as "Gloria" suddenly jumped off the youngman and spun around on the bed, her hand neverreleasing it’s grip on his hard cock.  Soon as thebrunette’s face reached his boyhood, it explodedin a shower of hot whiteness, covering her eagerlips and cheeks with his eruption.                The preview faded from view, to bereplaced by another scene.  It looked like thelocker room of the local high school.  From offcamera, the sound of running water could beheard from the showers.        "Anyone care to guess what kind of scenethis one is going to be?"  Penny asked, turning themovie into a sort of guessing game.        "My guess is the Quarterback andCheerleader."  Rachel said as she tossed half ahandful of popcorn into her mouth.        "Teacher and Student’s my guess." Stephanie said.        "I’m going to go with a gang bang." Penny offered with a wicked grin.        The Asian girl won that round as the starof the little epic, a tall statuesque blonde dressedin a very tight white uniform came into the lockerroom.  Evidently she was supposed to be theschool nurse.  She acted surprised when the soundof running water ceased and a half dozen nakedhunks walked into view.          In no time at all, the busty blonde waslaying on one of the benches, a stiff member ineach of her hands, a hard one in her mouth, afourth and fifth in her shaved pussy and tight ass. Standing just off to the right of the after-schoolorgy was the best looking of all the guys, playfullystroking the largest cock of the group and waitingfor an opening he could put it into.            "Guess she never heard of the idea thatyou can have too much of a good thing."  Rachelcommented.        "Maybe,"  Penny said.  "But I’d be glad totake care of the odd man out there."        "Get in line girl."  Stephanie cut in.                For so energetic a scene, it turned out tobe surprisingly short.  The odd man out never didfind his hole, but joined in with his buddies ingiving the nurse a cum shower.        "Well, so much for the idea that more isbetter."  Rachel said.        "Yeah, I think I prefer my sex one onone,"  Stephanie added.        "Me too,"  Penny chimed in.  "Well, maybetwo on one, but no more than that.  Except maybeon special occasions of course."                Rachel and Stephanie both laughed, notsure how much of Penny’s statement was intendedas a joke.         The scene shifted back to the boardroomwere several of the network executives were nowin various stages of undress, already engaged in sexual acts.  One of the female executives, a darkhaired thirty year old, was spread across the table,her dress up around her waist, her legs spreadwide.  Buried between those legs was the face of amale executive.  Kneeing beside that man was oneof the secretaries, her own mouth wrapped tightlyaround the cock sticking out from his threehundred dollar suit.          At the head of the table, the silver-grayhaired chairman of the board was also missing thelower half of his high priced suit, his own cockhowever was not as visible.  Instead it was buriedin the red-haired mound of the second secretarywho was being mounted doggie style by the seniorexecutive.          At the head of the room, the narrator ofthe film, who had also introducing the TV pilots,was trying to ignore the spectacle before him. Hecontinued to tell about the last show on theagenda.  It began to run on the monitor as thenarrator threw up his hand in surrender and pulledout his cock, sliding it into the mouth of theredhead.         The boardroom image faded, replaced bythe kitchen of a small apartment.  Standing at thecounter, her back to the camera, was a youngHispanic woman in her twenties.  Wearing a pairof cut off shorts and a red and white striped tanktop, she was pouring herself a cup of coffee.  Asshe turned to face the camera, a second cup became visible on the counter.  A smile crossed herlips as she tasted the steaming liquid.        Another figure then entered the kitchen, alight skinned brunette wearing a blue bathrobe.Her tousled short hair gave added evidence thatshe had just gotten out of bed. Pushing a lock ofloose hair away from her eyes, she accepted thesecond cup of coffee. In a brief chat the newarrival's name was revealed as Donna and thecoffee maker's as Modesta.         In no time at all, Donna’s robe fell opened,revealing a soft body accented by small curvingmounds, the pink nipples of which were both hardand visible.  The cup at her lips was quicklyreplaced by the equally hot lips of her companion.         With dazzling speed, the darker skinnedgirl traced a wet path down from the brunettes lipsto her breast. The nipple of which quicklydisappeared between her lips.         "Oh my!"  Stephanie gasped as shewatched the onscreen encounter advance to thenext stage.  She had crossed the room to pick upsome more muchies, but had stopped in mid stepat the sight.          In no time at all, Modesta's attentiondropped below her companion’s waist.  Stephaniehad seen women kiss each other on a few daringtelevision shows, had even seen them caress eachother’s breasts in an R rated film, but never hadshe seen a woman performing oral sex on anotherwoman.        The camera zoomed in, giving a close upview of Modesta’s tongue darting up and into thepink recesses of Donna’s pussy.  The picture wasso vivid that Stephanie could see the shiny layer ofnectar Modesta’s ministrations had produced.        ‘God, could you ever imagine doingsomething like that?"  Stephanie asked, her eyesnever leaving the screen.                It took a few long seconds for her torealize her friends hadn’t answered -- which shefound unusual.  She couldn’t ever remember thembeing at a loss for words!        "Could you ever imagine doing anythinglike that?"  she repeated, assuming they hadn’theard her.                The continued silence finally broke herfixation on the screen.  She turned her attentionback to Rachel.  The look on her girlfriend’s facewas akin to that of a kid who’d been caught witha hand in the cookie jar.                       "You’re kidding!"  Stephanie declared.        "Well, if you can be honest about RobbyMcPherson, then I should be honest too."  Rachel admitted.        "I don’t believe it,"  Stephanie said.  "Ithink now you’re putting me on.  Who have youever done it with?"                Rachel took a moment to think about heranswer.  Stephanie expected Rachel to say somedistant friend, if anything.  Instead the brunettelooked past the blond to the other end of the     couch.        Stephanie followed her line of sight, untilit stopped on an equally guilty face.        "Oh no, you had me going for a moment," Stephanie said, a touch of amusement in her tone."But now you’re stretching this a bit too far  --just a little bit over the top.  That was almost asgood as that story you had me believing aboutTracy Conway last month.                Tracy Conway was a somewhat masculinewoman in her thirties who also worked in the Mallat a sporting goods store.  One night, following afew hours of bar-hopping, the other girls hadconvinced Stephanie that Tracy was female as theresult of  a sex change operation.  It tookStephanie a week to discover it had been a joke.          Stephanie looked again at both of herfriends.  Neither one of them were laughing thistime.  Instead they shared a silent communication.        Without a word Penny got up from thecouch and walked past Stephanie. When shereached Rachel, the young Asian woman reachedup and gently stroked her cheek.  Then she pulledthe taller woman down to her level and kissed heron the lips.          It was a soft kiss at first, the kind that onefriend might give another, no different than someStephanie herself had gotten.  Then it becamemore and more erotic, a melding of lips and eagertongues.  Rachel responded in turn, pressing hardagainst the younger girl.        Stephanie was still trying to decide if thiswas a gag when Penny pushed the game evenfurther.  She slipped her hand up under Rachel’sT-shirt and fondled the naked flesh beneath it.         Breaking the kiss, she pulled up the thinmaterial and planted kisses on Rachel’s nowexposed breasts as well. Mimicking Modesta’sactions on the cable station, Penny slid her tongueunder Rachel’s erect nipple and guided it into hermouth.               "Shit,"  Stephanie finally exclaimed in arush of air. "This isn’t a joke."        With that, the two lovers ended theirembrace and faced their friend.  Their faces nowreflected a look of expectation.                Glancing back at the TV image, Stephanienoted that the two woman were now locked in a69 position, their mouths pressed tightly in eachother’s wet mounds.  What truly startled her wasthat, in her mind, instead of Donna and Modesta,the forms she now saw pressed together werethose of Rachel and Penny.                "Is it really as much fun as it looks?"  shewondered out loud.        In reply, she felt a soft hand come to reston her shoulder.           "We’d be happy to show you if you’rereally interested."  Rachel said.  "The only reasonwe never asked before is we weren’t sure of howyou’d react."        "Then why did you tell me now?" Stephanie asked.        "Honestly, I’m not sure,"  Stephanielaughed softly, trying to break the underlyingtension. "I didn’t plan it this way, it just seemedthe perfect time."        Stephanie thought about it for a briefmoment and decided that events had indeed madethis the perfect time.  The wine, the conversationthey’d been having had put them all at ease withwhat would normally have been a very awkwardsubject.        "And if  I thought that this wasn’t the sortof thing for me?"  Stephanie asked.        "Then I hope we’d just forget it all andstill be the same friends we all were 10 minutesago." Rachel replied.              Stephanie again looked past Rachel toPenny.  The younger girl hadn’t said a single wordsince Stephanie’s revelation.  She didn’t have to.The look in her eyes and on her face was amixture of apprehension and lust.        "Well I’ve always said,"  Stephanie said,placing her hand atop Rachel’s.  "You should tryeverything in life -- at least once."          She shifted her body ever so slightly, justenough to bring herself face to face with Rachel. Leaning forward, she pressed her lips against her.                It wasn’t the first time she had ever kissedRachel.  There had been many occasions when shekissed other girls, but never like this.  The touchof their lips now seemed electric.  A warmthspread throughout their bodies from that briefcontact.  The kiss was at the same time both briefand endless.          Still unsure of the situation, Rachel letStephanie take the lead.  It wasn’t until the blondkissed her a second time that Rachel began torespond.        Stephanie closed her eyes and the passionbuilding within her take control. She pushed hertongue into Rachel’s mouth, exploring thesoftness of it’s mirror image.        Rachel took hold of Stephanie’s hands andpressed them against her breasts. Tentatively, sheexplored the material covered mounds.  It was thefirst time she had ever felt the softness of aanother woman’s breast, the hardness of erectnipples.        As Stephanie continued to explore herfriends body, Rachel slid her own hands up anddown her friend’s back.  She took hold of thezipper of her dress and pulled it down, exposingthe flesh beneath it.  She caressed that flesh,running her nails across it.                The touch of a new hand caused Stephanieto open her eyes.  Penny now stood next to her aswell, a wide smile on her face.  Stephanie shiftedher attention to the youngest of her friends andkissed her too.  A kiss equal in intensity to thatshe had just given Rachel.  To Stephanie’s delight,the reaction she felt to it was also the same.        The three young women stood interlockedin the center of the room, kissing, exploring eachothers bodies, loosening clothing and searchingout the flesh beneath it.        "Maybe we should all just take a minuteand get comfortable."  Rachel suggestion.         The other’s nodded their agreement, andthey all took a few steps back from each other. Rachel was wearing the least so it took her only afew seconds to drop her shirt and panties to thefloor.  Standing naked in the center of the roomfor the second time that night, she took a momentto shut off the television. There was no longer anyneed for it, not when a much more interestingentertainment was about to commence.        Penny and Stephanie took only a littlelonger.  A small pile of clothes rested at eachgirl’s feet, topped by undergarments of variousdesigns.  Now they all stood naked, looking ateach other during an awkward pause.        Only a short time before, Stephanie hadfelt a little strange looking at Rachel’s nakedbody. Now she looked with a different eye.  All ofthem took a moment to look at each other.         Stephanie was surprised to see that Pennyhad shaved the hair between her legs.  She knewfrom brief glimpses that there never had beenmuch there to begin with.  But the absence of thatlittle bit made the small girl seem even more like ateenager. Rachel on the other hand, had a widepatch of dark brown hair.  Stephanie’s own bushwas somewhere between the two extremes and alight blond.        Even their breasts formed a sharp contrast, not just in size, ranging from Rachel’s 38C toPenny’s 34B, but in the very shape of them. Stephanie’s were very rounded with wide pinkcircles around short pink nipples.  Rachel’smounds were conical in nature with puffy areolasthat stuck out even further.  Penny had the darkestnipples of the three, a rich dark brown againstbutternut skin.                  "So now what?"  Stephanie asked as shetossed her hands up in the air.        "Why don’t you make yourselfcomfortable on the couch," Rachel suggested witha smile.  "and let us take care of getting thingsstarted."        Thinking it not a bad suggestion at all,Stephanie sat down on the center of the widecouch.  Rachel and Penny sat down beside her,tossing the larger throw pillows onto thehardwood floor.  They would come in handy later.        Penny kissed Stephanie.  Then Rachelkissed Stephanie.  Then, leaning across the middlegirl, Penny kissed Rachel.  As they did, they eachcupped the closest of Stephanie’s breasts, playingtheir fingers across her nipples - enjoying thestiffness found there.        Stephanie couldn’t help but compare thetouch of the two women to that of men she’dknown.  For the most part, it was softer -- yet atthe same time much more erotic.  As were the sensations it produced.  Even more pleasing werethe waves of delight that filled her breasts whenthose skillful fingers where replaced with evenmore talented mouths.         Matching tongues traced a path acrosssupple flesh, until they met in the rich valleybetween the mounds.  There the two lovers kissedonce more before parting in different directions.         Penny continued to kiss and caressStephanie’s breasts, alternating between softtouches and gentle bites.  Working her way backto Stephanie’s willing mouth, she pressed herdarker breasts hard against the those of the girlbeneath her. The nipple to nipple contact wasenough to elicit a soft moan from Stephanie.  Amoan cut short by the crush of Penny’s mouth.        Rachel had moved her attentions lower,dropping down to sit on one of the oversizedcushions.  With a hand on each of Stef’s thighs,she spread them apart to expose the blond-framedpearl.        Burying her head between the pale legs,Rachel ran her tongue along the length of herfriend’s womanhood -- her heart racing withexcitement at the idea that she was the firstwoman ever to do so.  The scent of Stephanie’salready damp mound was intoxicating, a feastwaiting to be savored.         Not to be denied, she drove her tongue upbetween the folds of those sugar walls, clearing apath to the clitoris.  A path quickly followed.        "Oh God!!"  Stephanie gasped as she feltRachel’s tongue strike her like the spark to amatch.  It was enough for her to momentaryforget the girl still playing with both her breastsand mouth.          But only for a moment as Penny liftedherself higher and guided one of her own richmounds to Stephanie’s lips.  Her mouth still openfrom her gasp, Penny pushed her erect nipplebetween the blonde’s red lips.        There had often been times whenStephanie had often wondered what it might feellike to suck on a woman’s breasts.  Her ownmounds were too small to try it on herself.  She’dincluded sucking on a man’s nipples as part of herloveplay, but she was sure it wasn’t the same.        Now with the reality between her teeth,she knew that her earlier conclusion was right. Playing with a man’s nipples was nothing like thereal thing of a woman.  She could taste Penny in away that she never could a man, delighting in themixture of soft and hard.  She ran her tongue backand forth across the dark, pert tips, trying torepeat the pleasing affect that Penny had producedin her.           As the now saturated nipple slipped fromher lips, Penny wrapped her hands around theback of Stephanie’s head, guiding her face to thesoft spot between her breasts, inviting her to feastthere as well, an invitation Stephanie was all toowilling to accept.  She licked her way across thedamp skin, enjoying the heady aroma filling hernostrils. Then with girlish delight she repeated herperformance on Penny’s other mound.        Her interest still fixed on Stephanie’spussy, Rachel slid one finger, then another deepwithin it.  The initial wetness she found there increased as she moved her fingers back and forth. With their motion waves of enchantmentexpanded to fill Stephanie’s relaxed form.        Rachel augmented the touch of her fingerswith that of her tongue, reaching her friend’s mostsensitive spots as if they were familiar as her own. In truth many of them were identical.          If Stephanie had time to think about it --which her two friends were definitely not allowing-- she might have appreciated the irony of thesituation.  Rachel, who cringed at the thought oftaking a man in her mouth, had no such hesitationwhere another woman was involved.        "This feels so fucking good!"  Stephaniemoaned as she laid back and enjoyed thetwo-pronged assault on her body.  "I don’t thinkI’ve ever felt this fantastic."         As Penny climbed off Stephanie, Rachelalso moved back.  Together they guided theirneophyte lover onto the large pillows they hadearlier tossed to the floor.  As soon as Stephanielaid across the pillows, Rachel again spread herlegs and went right back to where she left off.        Penny had other ideas.  It was timeStephanie learned how to give as well as receive.Squatting over Stephanie’s face, Penny droppeddown until her pussy was only a few inches aboveit.        Prior to this moment, Stephanie had neverseen another woman’s sex close up.  The fact thatPenny’s was totally hairless gave it an even moreinteresting perspective.  The first thing she noticedwas that for such a small girl, Penny had anunusually large clitoris. It was almost like a tinypenis.         No imagination was needed for Stephanieto figure out what Penny wanted. Unlike Rachel,Stephanie never had a problem with oral sex, sowith virginal enthusiasm, she reached out with hertongue and ran it across Penny’s erect clit.        "Oh yeah baby,"  Penny panted.  "Go forit!"        Go for it Stephanie did, pulling Penny’sclit between her lips, massaging it with hertongue.  Then she swept it back across the lengthof Penny’s pussy, savoring her first taste of awoman.          The scent of Penny's sex was almostoverpowering, and to her delight she learned withher first lick that the taste was all she hoped itwould be.  Penny lowered her pelvis further sothat Stephanie could have easier access to her wetcunt.          Slowly at first, Stephanie licked theyounger girl, exploring her womanhood.  Thenshe began to quicken the pace until she reached arhythm that sent little ripples throughout Penny'sbody.          Ripples that mirrored those fillingStephanie's body as Rachel continued to workmagic between her legs.  As one hand continuedto slide outstretched fingers up and down theblond framed love canal, the brunette’s other handworked the same enchantment on her own -- withmuch the same results.        Faster and faster all three of them went,plunging down the well of ecstasy.  It was a raceto rapture - a pursuit each wanted to win.          To her surprise, Stephanie produced thefirst orgasm as Penny’s body suddenly convulsedagainst her mouth and it filled with a blast ofhoney.  It was such a sexual rush that it sentStephanie’s own body over the edge, showering Rachel with the same gift.  A reward she hungrilyaccepted.        Finally, Rachel joined the chorus, meremoments behind the others, propelled by thesymphony of her fingers                  "Oh my god!"  Stephanie exclaimed asthey laid naked on the floor, still entwined in eachother’s bodies.  "I can’t believe how intense thatwas.  How did you ever get the idea to trysomething like this ... and how long have you beendoing it?"                "Well it was originally Penny’s idea." Rachel replied, running her hand alongsidePenny’s cheek.  "And we’ve been doing it, as youcall it, for the last six months."        Stephanie turned to Penny, but before shecould ask the question on her lips, Pennyanswered it with a laugh.        "I’ve been doing it since I was 16. Whatcan I say?  I’ve always been an advanced learner."                 The other two girls joined in the laughteras they continued to stroke and kiss each other. They all knew what had just happened was onlythe beginning.  There would be many more littleadventures in their collective future.                "Err ... Rachel,"  Stephanie suddenly askedseriously.  "Remember what you said earliertonight about the nameplate on the door?"        "Of course,"  Rachel answered, wonderingwhy Stephanie was suddenly concerned aboutsomething so mundane.        "I think you might want to try andremember that a little harder in the future." Stephanie continued.                "Oh shit!" Penny cried out abruptly, cutting off any further inquiry Rachel might havehad about Stephanie’s sudden tangent.                Rachel followed Penny’s gaze until allthree of them were looking at the front doorway. An entrance now filled by the tall figure of a darkskinned young woman in a bright red raincoat,holding a silver keychain in her hand.                "Fuck!"  Rachel blurted out," "Pamela!"        They all sat silent after that for longseconds,  like statues in some far off garden.                "Looks like I missed one hell of a party." Pamela said as she pulled off her raincoat anddraped it over a wall hook, revealing a bluebusiness suit.  "And here I thought I knew whatkind of people my friends were." she said in a hurttone.                 "Oh fuck!"  Rachel repeated.  The othertwo girls were still too stunned to say anythingelse.                "I am disappointed in you all,"  Pameladeclared as she stepped into the room and stoodover the naked trio.  "I thought we were supposedto be the Four Musketeers!"                It took a few seconds for them to realizethat the oldest of their little group wasn’t reallyangry or shocked at all. In fact, it was nowbecoming obvious that she hadn’t just walked ineither. How long she’d been watching was anquestion unasked -- at least for now.          With smiles now filling their faces, allthree girls reached up and pulled Pamela downinto the center of their circle.  She seemed a littleout of place with her conservative attire, butwithin a few minutes that was gone as well.  Herdark form was soon covered by an intermix oflighter hues.                Hours later, long after the rain hadstopped and the night once more grew quiet, thesounds of passion could still be heard.  Thequartet truly learned the meaning of their motto. One for all, and all for one.    END #*#

No evidence of any Severe Adverse Events (SAE's) in UK studies wasfound. The Working Party gave specific recommendations for appropriatepatient monitoring in a minority of studies where the route of administrationwas the same as that of the US trial. The Working Party report was sentto all GTAC members and will included in GTAC's 6th annual report. New Guidance. The draft Guidance for gene therapy trials was given to members for comment.Members were informed that GTAC had introduced a register to monitor allpatients from gene therapy trials, as will as any offspring from thosepatients up to the age of 16 years. 4. Protocol: A phase I studyof Trovax in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.The Chairman summarised the background to members. The protocol receivedfavourable external review, though a number of issues concerning patientparticipation and information leaflets were raised. Following extensivediscussion with the proposers, conditional approval was given subjectto a number of amendments to the original protocol. 5. Protocol: A phase I studyof DNA.Mel3 in patients with melanoma. The members were given background information for this study. Followingfavourable external review, conditional approval was given subject tomodifications to the patient information leaflets, patient inclusion criteriaand requirements for staff protection. 6. Protocol: A phase I/IIstudy of polyHER2 neu vaccine in the treatment of epithelial cancers.The Chairman summarised this protocol.

Crusador eAlertseALERTS - Sunday, August 15, 2004Back To Stories <<<Your Cheating Heart AssociationAug 18, 2004Author: Christopher BarrSource: Naturally Speaking Another case of selective recall about antioxidants came up last week in the medical community. This time the statement came from the American Heart Association (AHA)."Research fails to justify routine use of antioxidant supplements to prevent or treat cardiovascular disease," read a science advisory from the AHA. However it was noted that they only reviewed some studies over a limited period of time from 1995 to 2001. Even then it did not note that they considered all studies in those few years.Even so, at the end of the AHA press release it noted five studies that showed beneficial effects.Other studies both immediately prior to and following the few years noted by the AHA release directly contradicted their "routine use of antioxidant supplements to prevent or treat cardiovascular disease" statement.More selective recallThe AHA statement also concentrated on the better known but lesser strength antioxidants of beta-carotene, vitamin C and vitamin E. There was no mention of lesser known but greater strength antioxidants such as selenium.It would also be a safe bet that less expensive, man-made, synthetic supplements were utilized as usual in the unfavorable studies rather than nutrients from foods.Honesty the best policy?These kinds of less than honest policy statements have been routine at the AHA for many decades.Almost 40 years ago Dr. Henry Alfred Schroeder (of Yale, Columbia and Dartmouth universities) was their keynote speaker at the AHA George Brown Memorial Lecture and received many accolades. He developed the low salt diet for hypertension (high blood pressure) and heart disease, and developed the first hypertension drug treatment.Shortly thereafter Dr. Schroeder discovered that it was not the sodium of salt that was the problem but rather that salt was a carrier of the heavy metal cadmium.The AHA ignored that more recent finding of Schroeder.Selenium is the only element that removes cadmium. Selenium has also been shown for decades to be a preventative for heart disease. No naturally occurring element is a greater antioxidant, yet the AHA is ignoring that antioxidant in their recent ANTI-antioxidant pronouncement.Yet a little later Dr. Schroeder revealed that cholesterol was not the culprit it was made out to be regarding heart disease. He announced that chromium managed cholesterol. In the absence of chromium then cholesterol would be out of control. Schroeder determined through extensive animal and human studies that chromium deficiency was a primary cause of heart disease.The AHA also ignored that later finding of Schroeder and has continued in that ignorance for more than 30 years.Chromium also has its greatest action as part of the Glucose Tolerance Factor (GTF) molecule. GTF also happens to be an antioxidant. GTF happens to be an antioxidant also absent from mention in the AHA policy statement against antioxidant supplements.For decades heart disease has been unchallenged as the number one killer of both men and women. How much longer shall people continue to suffer and die in such great numbers with so much research for so long about antioxidants against heart disease?Should the AHA be renamed the American Hurt Association?Christopher C.

If successful, no flight operations would be allowed during those hours, with a few exceptions including law enforcement and emergency medical operations, and those in violation would be subject to fines ranging from $1,000 to $5,000.FAR Part 161 requires that a benefit cost analysis be conducted before any measure that would restrict aircraft operations is implemented.

Nevertheless, it was the most successful attempt to date, setting a world record for time aloft, 12 days, 12 hours, and 57 minutes over a distance of more than 12,690 statute miles. A complete journey will take 19 days and cover some 22,000 miles flying at altitudes between 20,000 and 30,000 feet.

Appendix A of Part 43 lists, in paragraph (c), items which are considered to be "Preventive Maintenance".  The items listed as preventive maintenance can be performed by a person who holds a private pilot certificate or higher, as authorized by Part 43.3, paragraph (g), which states:"(g) The holder of a pilot certificate issued under Part 61 may perform preventive maintenance on any aircraft owned or operated by that pilot which is not used under Part 121, 129, or 135."The specific listings in Part 43, Appendix A that allow you to change the oil in your personal aircraft are items (6) and (23):(6) Lubrication not requiring disassembly other than removal of nonstructural items such as cover plates, cowlings, and fairings.(23) Cleaning or replacing fuel and oil strainers or filter elements.FAA Advisory Circular AC 43-12A offers guidance on preventive maintenance.  Paragraph (4)(g) of this AC specifically states that the above mentioned items authorize you to change the oil and filter of your aircraft (providing you hold a private pilot certificate or higher).How can we help you?

The items listed as preventive maintenance can be performed by a person who holds a private pilot certificate or higher, as authorized by Part 43.3, paragraph (g), which states:"(g) The holder of a pilot certificate issued under Part 61 may perform preventive maintenance on any aircraft owned or operated by that pilot which is not used under Part 121, 129, or 135."The specific listings in Part 43, Appendix A that allow you to change the oil in your personal aircraft are items (6) and (23):(6) Lubrication not requiring disassembly other than removal of nonstructural items such as cover plates, cowlings, and fairings.(23) Cleaning or replacing fuel and oil strainers or filter elements.FAA Advisory Circular AC 43-12A offers guidance on preventive maintenance.

His movie career launched, Liam began to appear in a number of British and American productions, including The Bounty The Lamb  and The Mission More roles and great co-stars followed: Cher in Suspect , Diane Keaton in The Good Mother , and Clint Eastwood in The Dead Pool Darkman  and a Nazi opposite Melanie Griffith in Shining Through Husbands and Wives Before that, in 1984, he made his American TV debut in the mini-series Ellis Island  and played an IRA operative on Miami Vice The 1992 Broadway revival of Anna Christie  was good for Liam in two ways. First, Steven Spielberg was so impressed by his performance that he offered him the lead in his Holocast film Neeson followed his work in with Nell , co-starring his wife and Jodie Foster. He then went on to Rob Roy Braveheart . That was followed with the biopic Michael Collins  and the Meryl Streep film Before and After In an interview that appeared in the June 1999 issue of Redbook , Neeson said he planned to retire from movie acting in 2000, though the theatre will still beckon him. In the interview he said, "Film is a director's medium. We are basically puppets. Producers earn all the money, and you get the sense that they hate actors. The crews are treated like slaves. ... I don't think I can live with the inauthenticity of movies anymore. I don't like watching them, especially my own stuff." Of course, Hollywood is always a never say never environment. Days after this statement was released, Liam told reporters in New York that he wasn't quitting and that he was just venting some anger and frustrations.6.

His movie career launched, Liam began to appear in a number of British and American productions, including #*#The Bounty The Lamb #*# and #*#The Mission #*#More roles and great co-stars followed: Cher in #*#Suspect #*#, Diane Keaton in #*#The Good Mother #*#, and Clint Eastwood in #*#The Dead Pool Darkman #*# and a Nazi opposite Melanie Griffith in #*#Shining Through Husbands and Wives #*#Before that, in 1984, he made his American TV debut in the mini-series #*#Ellis Island #*# and played an IRA operative on #*#Miami Vice #*#The 1992 Broadway revival of #*#Anna Christie #*# was good for Liam in two ways. First, Steven Spielberg was so impressed by his performance that he offered him the lead in his Holocast film Neeson followed his work in with #*#Nell #*#, co-starring his wife and Jodie Foster. He then went on to #*#Rob Roy Braveheart #*#. That was followed with the biopic #*#Michael Collins #*# and the Meryl Streep film #*#Before and After #*#In an interview that appeared in the June 1999 issue of #*#Redbook #*#, Neeson said he planned to retire from movie acting in 2000, though the theatre will still beckon him. In the interview he said, "Film is a director's medium. We are basically puppets. Producers earn all the money, and you get the sense that they hate actors. The crews are treated like slaves. ... I don't think I can live with the inauthenticity of movies anymore. I don't like watching them, especially my own stuff." Of course, Hollywood is always a never say never environment. Days after this statement was released, Liam told reporters in New York that he wasn't quitting and that he was just venting some anger and frustrations.#*#6.

If successful, no flight operations would be allowed during those hours, with a few exceptions including law enforcement and emergency medical operations, and those in violation would be subject to fines ranging from $1,000 to $5,000.FAR Part 161 requires that a benefit cost analysis be conducted before any measure that would restrict aircraft operations is implemented. In Burbank’s case, petitioners need to demonstrate that the benefits of noise abatement will outweigh potential negative economic impact.(readmore)  Steve Fossett Hopes Sixth Time is the CharmBalloonist Steve Fossett, EAA 562868, will make his sixth attempt next month to become the first person to fly nonstop around-the-world in the airship Bud Light Spirit of Freedom. Fossett aborted his fifth attempt in the Solo Spirit last year because of severe weather and depleted oxygen supplies. Nevertheless, it was the most successful attempt to date, setting a world record for time aloft, 12 days, 12 hours, and 57 minutes over a distance of more than 12,690 statute miles. A complete journey will take 19 days and cover some 22,000 miles flying at altitudes between 20,000 and 30,000 feet. Fossett, a member of the EAA President’s Council, will begin his journey the first opportunity on or after June 13, depending on weather conditions.(readmore)FAA Working to Post All Sport Pilot CommentsEAA’s Government Relations office received calls from concerned members whose submitted final comments to the sport pilot NPRM have yet to be posted on the DOT web site. EAA forwarded about 300 final comments from its members to the FAA on the last weekend before the May 6 deadline, and a similar amount were sent directly to the agency via e-mail.The result of this late surge is the DOT Docket Office was inundated with comments, and not only for sport pilot but for other unrelated NPRM comment periods that closed near the same day.“The docket office was swamped with last-minute comments and is feverishly trying to get them all in the system,” said Judy S. Courbois from the FAA Office of Rulemaking. Evidently the office also had some minor problems with the electronic submissions, which they are working on. However, there is no need to re-submit any comments, Courbois stressed. The FAAwas intending to have all comments that were received by May 6 posted in the docket sometime this week.To view Sport Pilot comments submitted to DOT, visit http://dms.dot.gov/search/searchFormSimple.cfm,and enter docket number 11133 in the search block.33-hour Simulated Lindbergh Flight Set to Begin Monday MorningSix EAA memberswill be cleared and ready for takeoff at 7.52 CDT Monday morning, at EAA AirVenture Museum in Oshkosh,Wisconsin, and for the next 33 hours will simulate Charles Lindbergh'sepic trans-Atlantic flight of 75 years ago. The volunteer pilots will flythrough the night until about 5.00 p.m. on May 21, approximating Lindbergh time in the air used to fly across the Atlantic.The simulation software was specially created by Flight One Software to work with Microsoft's Flight Simulator 2002 and match the flight characteristics of Lindbergh's modified Ryan M-2 monoplane. The volunteers willfly across a virtual Atlantic to LeBourget airport outside Paris just as Lindbergh did in 1927.Museum visitors will also be able to fly along on a separate simulatorduring regular museum hours.MUSEUM NOTE:Sunday hours for EAA AirVenture Museum in Oshkosh are now 10 a.m.-5 p.m.,which is one hour earlier than previously.Aviator/Author Richard BachTo Appear at Author's CornerMillions of Americans in the early 1970s were introduced to author Richard Bach through his inspirational story about a seagull who was more interested in following a higher calling than simply existing. The book,Jonathan Livingston Seagull, sold over 20 million copies in 40 languages and became part of the international literary lexicon.Bach, EAA 25906, has written about a dozen books including  Stranger To The Ground, A Gift ofWings, and Biplane. Aviation and flight, his life’s passions, have always figured prominently in his writing.Bach will present his latest works at AirVenture Oshkosh 2002’s Author’s Corner, the first two installments of his anticipated five-book Ferret Chronicles series: Rescue Ferrets at Sea  and  Air Ferrets Aloft.(read more)Still RoomFor More OperationPOP Volunteers Interest in volunteering for Operation: Protect Our Planes (POP) is running ahead of last year, say organizers for the AirVenture flight line courtesy and safety corps. There is still room, however, for those who want to participate. The mission of POP, brought to you by CirrusDesign Corp., is to thank aircraft owners/operators for bringing their special aircraft to AirVenture and to remind visitors to respect the aircraft and surrounding areas by observing Flight Line etiquette, that is: No touching/handling of aircraft except with owner/crew present; no smoking on the flight line or in the vicinity of any aircraft; no smoking inside any AirVenture building/structures; no food or drink within 10 feet of any aircraft; no coolers (except campers with permits); no alcohol; and no pets. If you are interested in joining, contact Noel Marshall atnmarshall@eaamail.org or Theresa Lautenschlager attlautenschlager@eaa.org.On The Flight Line ---Policy Changed to Speed Special Issue Class III MedicalsFederal Air Surgeon Dr. Jon Jordan recently announced a new policy that allows pilots with certain medical conditions to renew their special issuance medical certificate with their local aviation medical examiners (AMEs), provided they have proper documentation (medical records).The new initiative is limited to airmen seeking third class medicals and only applies to 20 specific medical conditions. These conditions are: asthma, chronic obstructive airway disease, sleep apnea, history of arterial fibrillation, paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, colon cancer, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, lymphoma, prostate cancer, non-physiologic heart murmur, arthritis, colitis, urolithiasis, diet-controlled diabetes mellitus, glaucoma, ocular hypertension, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and a history of migraine syndrome.Renewals previously required pilots to submit requests to the Aerospace Medical Certification Division (AMCD) in Oklahoma City, often resulting in frustrating delays. EAA’s Aeromedical Council had been a proponent of this policy change for several years through several meetings and work groups. EAA continues to work with FAA to streamline procedures and eliminate roadblocks for obtaining FAA medical certification.  MGL Stratomaster Extreme Fits in Tight Spots and BudgetsMGL Avionics’ Stratomaster Extreme is a lightweight, affordable andsurprisingly powerful primary flight and electronic instrument system for use in light aircraft.

Appendix A of Part 43 lists, in paragraph (c), items which are considered to be "Preventive Maintenance".  The items listed as preventive maintenance can be performed by a person who holds a private pilot certificate or higher, as authorized by Part 43.3, paragraph (g), which states:"(g) The holder of a pilot certificate issued under Part 61 may perform preventive maintenance on any aircraft owned or operated by that pilot which is not used under Part 121, 129, or 135."The specific listings in Part 43, Appendix A that allow you to change the oil in your personal aircraft are items (6) and (23):(6) Lubrication not requiring disassembly other than removal of nonstructural items such as cover plates, cowlings, and fairings.(23) Cleaning or replacing fuel and oil strainers or filter elements.FAA Advisory Circular AC 43-12A offers guidance on preventive maintenance.  Paragraph (4)(g) of this AC specifically states that the above mentioned items authorize you to change the oil and filter of your aircraft (providing you hold a private pilot certificate or higher).How can we help you?

If successful, no flight operations would be allowed during those hours, with a few exceptions including law enforcement and emergency medical operations, and those in violation would be subject to fines ranging from $1,000 to $5,000.FAR Part 161 requires that a benefit cost analysis be conducted before any measure that would restrict aircraft operations is implemented. In Burbank’s case, petitioners need to demonstrate that the benefits of noise abatement will outweigh potential negative economic impact.(readmore)  Steve Fossett Hopes Sixth Time is the CharmBalloonist Steve Fossett, EAA 562868, will make his sixth attempt next month to become the first person to fly nonstop around-the-world in the airship Bud Light Spirit of Freedom. Fossett aborted his fifth attempt in the Solo Spirit last year because of severe weather and depleted oxygen supplies. Nevertheless, it was the most successful attempt to date, setting a world record for time aloft, 12 days, 12 hours, and 57 minutes over a distance of more than 12,690 statute miles. A complete journey will take 19 days and cover some 22,000 miles flying at altitudes between 20,000 and 30,000 feet. Fossett, a member of the EAA President’s Council, will begin his journey the first opportunity on or after June 13, depending on weather conditions.(readmore)FAA Working to Post All Sport Pilot CommentsEAA’s Government Relations office received calls from concerned members whose submitted final comments to the sport pilot NPRM have yet to be posted on the DOT web site. EAA forwarded about 300 final comments from its members to the FAA on the last weekend before the May 6 deadline, and a similar amount were sent directly to the agency via e-mail.The result of this late surge is the DOT Docket Office was inundated with comments, and not only for sport pilot but for other unrelated NPRM comment periods that closed near the same day.“The docket office was swamped with last-minute comments and is feverishly trying to get them all in the system,” said Judy S.

Make it your first!For the latest information, visit www.airventure.org  #*#News You Can Use---EAA Member Asks Pilots Across the Nation to Join ‘Flight Across America’For 32 consecutive days this summer, pilots from thousands of airports across the country will take part in The Flight Across America, a national celebration for the freedom of flight combined with a unique commemoration of the 9/11 tragedy.The event is being organized by Molly Peebles, EAA 687879, a Washington State resident who learned how to fly this past year.“Last year, we witnessed aviation being used as a tool for incredible destruction,” said Peebles, who noted her check ride was originally scheduled for 9/11/01. “This year, we pilots have an opportunity to reclaim our skies by using aviation as a tool for great inspiration and bringing people together across the country to do something that has never been done before.”(readmore)EAA Opposes Attempt to ImposeFlight Operations Curfew at Burbank AirportEAA opposes the city of Burbank, California, and the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena (BUR) Airport Authority attempt to impose an unprecedented 10 p.m.-7 a.m. ban on all airport flight operations for noise reduction purposes. If successful, no flight operations would be allowed during those hours, with a few exceptions including law enforcement and emergency medical operations, and those in violation would be subject to fines ranging from $1,000 to $5,000.FAR Part 161 requires that a benefit cost analysis be conducted before any measure that would restrict aircraft operations is implemented. In Burbank’s case, petitioners need to demonstrate that the benefits of noise abatement will outweigh potential negative economic impact.(readmore)  Steve Fossett Hopes Sixth Time is the CharmBalloonist Steve Fossett, EAA 562868, will make his sixth attempt next month to become the first person to fly nonstop around-the-world in the airship Bud Light Spirit of Freedom. Fossett aborted his fifth attempt in the Solo Spirit last year because of severe weather and depleted oxygen supplies. Nevertheless, it was the most successful attempt to date, setting a world record for time aloft, 12 days, 12 hours, and 57 minutes over a distance of more than 12,690 statute miles. A complete journey will take 19 days and cover some 22,000 miles flying at altitudes between 20,000 and 30,000 feet. Fossett, a member of the EAA President’s Council, will begin his journey the first opportunity on or after June 13, depending on weather conditions.(readmore)FAA Working to Post All Sport Pilot CommentsEAA’s Government Relations office received calls from concerned members whose submitted final comments to the sport pilot NPRM have yet to be posted on the DOT web site. EAA forwarded about 300 final comments from its members to the FAA on the last weekend before the May 6 deadline, and a similar amount were sent directly to the agency via e-mail.The result of this late surge is the DOT Docket Office was inundated with comments, and not only for sport pilot but for other unrelated NPRM comment periods that closed near the same day.“The docket office was swamped with last-minute comments and is feverishly trying to get them all in the system,” said Judy S. Courbois from the FAA Office of Rulemaking. Evidently the office also had some minor problems with the electronic submissions, which they are working on. However, there is no need to re-submit any comments, Courbois stressed. The FAAwas intending to have all comments that were received by May 6 posted in the docket sometime this week.To view Sport Pilot comments submitted to DOT, visit http://dms.dot.gov/search/searchFormSimple.cfm,and enter docket number 11133 in the search block.33-hour Simulated Lindbergh Flight Set to Begin Monday MorningSix EAA memberswill be cleared and ready for takeoff at 7.52 CDT Monday morning, at EAA AirVenture Museum in Oshkosh,Wisconsin, and for the next 33 hours will simulate Charles Lindbergh'sepic trans-Atlantic flight of 75 years ago. The volunteer pilots will flythrough the night until about 5.00 p.m. on May 21, approximating Lindbergh time in the air used to fly across the Atlantic.The simulation software was specially created by Flight One Software to work with Microsoft's Flight Simulator 2002 and match the flight characteristics of Lindbergh's modified Ryan M-2 monoplane. The volunteers willfly across a virtual Atlantic to LeBourget airport outside Paris just as Lindbergh did in 1927.Museum visitors will also be able to fly along on a separate simulatorduring regular museum hours.MUSEUM NOTE:Sunday hours for EAA AirVenture Museum in Oshkosh are now 10 a.m.-5 p.m.,which is one hour earlier than previously.Aviator/Author Richard BachTo Appear at Author's CornerMillions of Americans in the early 1970s were introduced to author Richard Bach through his inspirational story about a seagull who was more interested in following a higher calling than simply existing. The book,Jonathan Livingston Seagull, sold over 20 million copies in 40 languages and became part of the international literary lexicon.Bach, EAA 25906, has written about a dozen books including  Stranger To The Ground, A Gift ofWings, and Biplane. Aviation and flight, his life’s passions, have always figured prominently in his writing.Bach will present his latest works at AirVenture Oshkosh 2002’s Author’s Corner, the first two installments of his anticipated five-book Ferret Chronicles series: Rescue Ferrets at Sea  and  Air Ferrets Aloft.(read more)Still RoomFor More OperationPOP Volunteers Interest in volunteering for Operation: Protect Our Planes (POP) is running ahead of last year, say organizers for the AirVenture flight line courtesy and safety corps. There is still room, however, for those who want to participate. The mission of POP, brought to you by CirrusDesign Corp., is to thank aircraft owners/operators for bringing their special aircraft to AirVenture and to remind visitors to respect the aircraft and surrounding areas by observing Flight Line etiquette, that is: No touching/handling of aircraft except with owner/crew present; no smoking on the flight line or in the vicinity of any aircraft; no smoking inside any AirVenture building/structures; no food or drink within 10 feet of any aircraft; no coolers (except campers with permits); no alcohol; and no pets. If you are interested in joining, contact Noel Marshall atnmarshall@eaamail.org or Theresa Lautenschlager attlautenschlager@eaa.org.On The Flight Line ---Policy Changed to Speed Special Issue Class III MedicalsFederal Air Surgeon Dr. Jon Jordan recently announced a new policy that allows pilots with certain medical conditions to renew their special issuance medical certificate with their local aviation medical examiners (AMEs), provided they have proper documentation (medical records).The new initiative is limited to airmen seeking third class medicals and only applies to 20 specific medical conditions. These conditions are: asthma, chronic obstructive airway disease, sleep apnea, history of arterial fibrillation, paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, colon cancer, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, lymphoma, prostate cancer, non-physiologic heart murmur, arthritis, colitis, urolithiasis, diet-controlled diabetes mellitus, glaucoma, ocular hypertension, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, and a history of migraine syndrome.Renewals previously required pilots to submit requests to the Aerospace Medical Certification Division (AMCD) in Oklahoma City, often resulting in frustrating delays. EAA’s Aeromedical Council had been a proponent of this policy change for several years through several meetings and work groups. EAA continues to work with FAA to streamline procedures and eliminate roadblocks for obtaining FAA medical certification.  MGL Stratomaster Extreme Fits in Tight Spots and BudgetsMGL Avionics’ Stratomaster Extreme is a lightweight, affordable andsurprisingly powerful primary flight and electronic instrument system for use in light aircraft.

Appendix A of Part 43 lists, in paragraph (c), items which are considered to be "Preventive Maintenance".  The items listed as preventive maintenance can be performed by a person who holds a private pilot certificate or higher, as authorized by Part 43.3, paragraph (g), which states:"(g) The holder of a pilot certificate issued under Part 61 may perform preventive maintenance on any aircraft owned or operated by that pilot which is not used under Part 121, 129, or 135."The specific listings in Part 43, Appendix A that allow you to change the oil in your personal aircraft are items (6) and (23):(6) Lubrication not requiring disassembly other than removal of nonstructural items such as cover plates, cowlings, and fairings.(23) Cleaning or replacing fuel and oil strainers or filter elements.FAA Advisory Circular AC 43-12A offers guidance on preventive maintenance.  Paragraph (4)(g) of this AC specifically states that the above mentioned items authorize you to change the oil and filter of your aircraft (providing you hold a private pilot certificate or higher).How can we help you?

90.03.08: The Four Corners Region of the United States Cultures, Ruins and LandmarksYale-New Haven Teachers InstituteHomeThe Four Corners Region of the United States Cultures, Ruins and LandmarksbyLilly Ann SantorelliContents of Curriculum Unit 90.03.08:NarrativeHistorical OverviewBibliographyTo Guide EntryThe goal of this unit is to broaden the horizons of the inner city children. I would like to use a holistic approach to teaching this unit. The children have very little experience in the following areas: map skills, origin of the states, regional cultural differences and similarities, and the historical landmarks that exist in our world today. I would like the children to use their creative side of the brain. An experiential, hands-on approach to teaching this unit is suggested, since most children tend to lose interest quickly unless stimulated to learn.The curriculum can be used for kindergarten through eighth graders. My population consists of fifth to seventh graders in a special education classroom. They range from non-readers to fourth grade readers. These students are fascinated by drama, music, art, dance, imagery and affective educational learning techniques.After this unit is completed, I intend to discuss a unit on the Quinnipiac Indians of New Haven. There are many Indian landmarks to explore in our area. This would provide for a very real closure activity.The area I will be focusing on will be the Four Corners Region of the United States. This area is comprised of Utah, New Mexico, Arizona and Colorado. The children of New Haven know about their surroundings; this unit will allow them to venture out of New Haven upon unknown territory. They have no knowledge of the distance of the United States; this unit will provide some meaningful experiences as to our whereabouts as compared to the states in the United States.Long before Columbus first saw America, this land was occupied by Indians. They lived here for about 1300 years until they were driven out by a long drought which lasted years. However, the Indians left stories behind them without having anything written. Archeologists read by studying the baskets, pottery, weapons and dwellings of the ancient inhabitants. These remnants of a past civilization have been well preserved.Children can become amateur archeologists and learn more about our earlier cultures in a land that still exists.HISTORICAL OVERVIEWArizonaThe name Arizona comes from an Indian word meaning “Arizonac” or Little Spring. It is a big state in the Southwestern United States. Throughout Arizona you can see relics of ancient people. In 1863, Arizona was made into a territory. It was a land filled with gold mines and Indians, and people came there looking for metals such as gold, silver and copper.Arizona is known as the Grand Canyon state. Most of the land is high, flat land gouged out by canyons; it is considered a plateau region filled with mountains.There are Indian nations in this land that are almost a thousand years old. The Hopi and Navajo are just two of these nations living there now. Much of Arizona is desert land with cactus plants. These plants can live up to five years without rainfall since they store juices for the time when there is no rain. These cactus bloom in the spring and bear fruit in the summer. The actual state flower of Arizona is the white flower from a sequaro cactus plant.Various animals live in Arizona, including mountain lions, bobcats, deer, black bears, foxes and antelopes. The pack rat is quite unique because he steals things but in return leaves a pine cone or piece of cactus. Snakes, scorpions, tarantulas and many kinds of lizards exist in the Arizona desert.Throughout Arizona you can see the influence Mexicans have had on this area. This influence is reflected in buildings, foods, festivals, and schools which teach Spanish as well as English. Indians are also a large population in Arizona. Many of Arizona’s Indian nations have lived there for hundreds of years on reservations. Some live modern lifestyles, and some follow the traditional ones of long ago. The Navajo are an Indian nation of Arizona who are famous for making rugs that are weaved, and blankets. They are also very good business people. There are also Hopi Indians living in a village that is said to be over 800 years old. The Hopi village of Oraibi may be the oldest American town. It was started in 1200 A.D. and people still live there.New MexicoNew Mexico is the 47th state and was established on January 6, 1912. The capital is Santa Fe, and the state is called the Land of Enchantment. Most of New Mexico’s land consists of high plateaus or mesas, mountain ranges, canyons, valleys and dry arroyos.New Mexico is one of only four states whose water flows into three major river systems. The most important river in the state is the Rio Grande, which flows clear across New Mexico to become one of the five major river systems of the United States. New Mexico is dry and has elevated surfaces that were once covered with water. Much of the land was raised or lowered by forces from below. Mountain ranges were formed, but seas swept in and wore down the area. Then, in the west and northwest areas of the state, came volcanic activity. Volcanic ash accumulated and flows of lava poured out over the land. As the land continued to rise, parts of the region became mountains. The country’s biggest range, the Rocky Mountains, was formed. During the Ice Age glaciers covered the peaks of mountains, valleys were shaped, and canyons were cut.A wide variety of fossils of animals have been found in present day New Mexico. These include fish, reptiles, and dinosaurs.New Mexico is often known as the Sunshine State. The sun shines as much in winter as in the summer. Clean air, high mountains, level prairies, valleys and fields make New Mexico quite unique.The ancient people of New Mexico have been among the most studied anywhere. Things they left behind thousands of years ago tell the story of the land. Some of the oldest remains of people have been found there. Cave dwellers roamed the area, and the Basketmakers were a group of people that came in next. They hunted and raised crops, and built houses which were sunk below the level of the ground. The Pueblo people invented villages and houses that resembled our condominiums, architecturally, and systems of irrigation were developed. Arts and crafts, pumpkin growing, and weaving and pottery were all practiced. Indian art on walls and caves tells of the historical events in New Mexico. The Pueblo were a peaceful group of people. The Navajo acquainted themselves with the Pueblo. The two cultures shared different styles of living.Life in New Mexico now is influenced by three cultures. They are Indian, Spanish, and English-speaking Americans. The architecture reflects Indian Pueblo and Spanish styles. The area is still known for woodcarving, talented weavers, and for fine Spanish food.UtahUtah is west of the Great Divide and halfway between Canada and Mexico. It is the 11th largest state in the United States. Arizona borders it on the south, Nevada on the west, Idaho and Wyoming on the north, and Wyoming and Colorado are on the east. At the southwest corner is the only spot in the United States where the four states meet.In 1776, Spanish missionaries opened the route for the Old Spanish Trail. This was between Santa Fe and Utah Lake. The Ute Indians lived in this region. The word “Ute”, which means people of the mountains, became the name of the state. There were several large tribes that made up the Ute Nation. Then came the Paiutes, and Shoshone Indians.John C. Fremont, in 1843-44, made an expedition to Oregon and went to Great Salt Lake Valley. He was the first to make maps and report on this region. In 1844, Brigham Young became leader of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This was a religious group known as the Mormons. For years, the Mormons were driven from state to state. People didn’t approve of the Mormons’ beliefs and ways of life. Brigham Young headed for Utah in 1846 with a small group of Mormons. They built cabins, planted crops, and found a new home. Brigham Young tried to set up a government, but between the Ute Indians and President Fillmore, it failed.In 1848, a group of hungry crickets started eating the crops and starvation occurred. A flock of seagulls appeared and ate the crickets. Some years later, the Mormons put up a Sea Gull Monument on Temple Square in Salt Lake City. These birds are protected by law because they were so helpful.On January 4, 1896, Utah became the 45th state. It is the eleventh largest state in the United States. The capital is Salt Lake City, and the nickname for the state is the beehive state. It is known for its industry. The state tree is the Blue Spruce and the flower is the Sego Lily.Utah is quite a unique state. The Wasatch Mountains form a spine down the middle of the state. West of the mountains is a green band of land fertile from irrigation, and west of this band is a section of desert. This large area in Western Utah is called the Great Basin, and in the south end of the basin is Utah Lake, the largest fresh water lake in the state.East of the Wasatch Mountains is the Colorado Plateau. This is a desert area that changes from yellow to red as it nears the Colorado River. Mountains and plateaus make up most of the state. Utah is one of the largest silver producing states in the nation. Petroleum, lead, and zinc are taken from the Utah mines. The Mormons learned about coal and how it burned from the Indians. This helped Utah become a prosperous coal industry state.ColoradoThe beautiful state of Colorado sits on top of the world. It is known as the highest state in the union. One thousand five hundred peaks in this state tower ten thousand feet or more above sea level. These snow-capped Rocky Mountains are the most striking feature of Colorado. This divides the state into two sections. On the east side of the mountains, rivers flow east into the Mississippi Valley. On the west, they flow west into the Pacific Ocean. Because they separate the rivers in this way, the Rocky Mountains’ peaks are called the Continental Divide.Colorado lies about halfway between Canada on the north and Mexico on the south. The state is shaped like a rectangle and covers 103,948 square miles.It is believed that Coronado was the first white man to exist in the Colorado area. He came in 1541. He was a famous Spaniard seeking the seven cities of Cibola and their treasures of gold. In 1706, another Spanish explorer, Juan de Uribarri, took possession of the region. He did this in the name of Spain, and called it Santo Domingo. Over the next hundred years, France and Spain fought each other for possession of this area. In 1803, the United States bought this territory from France. This was called the Louisiana Purchase, and cost 15 million dollars. After all the explorers, hunters and trappers came to the region of Colorado.The first settlement in Colorado was in 1853. Six years later the first school was opened in Auraria. It was a one room log cabin with a mud roof. In 1858 gold was discovered in the streams far into the mountains. In a few years the gold disappeared. Families settled on the river valley and began planting crops and establishing farms.In 1867, the capital became Denver. Bridges were put up, roads were built, and the Denver and Rio Grande railroad was developed. On August 1, 1876, Colorado was admitted to the Union as the 38th state.The mild climate and sunshine help the farmers in Colorado grow wheat, corn, hay and alfalfa. Colorado also leads the nation in the growing of sugar beets.Coal is the chief mineral product of Colorado today. The large coal mines supply fuel for many industries, including the giant steel mills. This mountain state also has a supply of building materials, such as granite, marble and sandstone. Limestone and lava are mined here and sent all over.Colorado has forests of pine, fir, and spruce which cover millions of acres. In order to preserve the trees, the government set aside thirteen million acres as national forests. They cover one-fifth of the state.Denver lies just north of the center of the state. It is the largest city in Colorado and is named the Queen city of the Plains because of the business and tourist center located there. The State Museum Building contains relics of the Pueblo Indians and the Cliff Dwellers of long ago. It also shows the development of transportation in the west.Some cities of Colorado hold lots of historical artifacts. Pueblo, a city of factories and steel mills, is 40 miles south of Colorado Springs. It is the second largest city in the state, and its history goes back to the Spanish days. In 1806, Lieutenant Zebulon Pike erected the first building built by Americans in Colorado. Pueblo has been filled with trappers, hunters, and people seeking gold. It is a city filled with many races and nationalities. In Trinidad, a city in the extreme southern part of Colorado, lies the Kit Carson Museum which contains pioneer relics.Mesa VerdeMesa Verde is a park in the southwestern corner of Colorado. Since it is covered by plateau evergreens, juniper and pinion, the Spanish named it Mesa Verde, meaning Green Table. This park protects one of the most impressive groups of prehistoric Indian structures north of Mexico. The ancient buildings are set in a wilderness of forested canyons and mesas, too. There are villages such as Cliff Palace, Spruce Tree House, and Square Tower House. According to archeologists, the primitive civilization started at the beginning of the first century A.D. and continued to the 13th century.During the Basketmakers period A.D. to 450, the Indians raised squash and corn on the mesas and lived in caves. During the next 300 years, the Indians discovered how to make pottery, along with baskets. They also developed a new kind of dwelling, shallow pits dug in the mesas’ tops and roofed with poles covered with mud. During the Developmental Pueblo Period, which was from 750-1100, the Indians used different methods of constructing walls of stone, mud, and poles. Then they began joining their houses to form villages. Up to this time there had been peace, and the Indians progressed in the following areas: arts and crafts, population, and farming.Prehistoric Indians farmed the Mesa Verde for over a thousand years. Their structures consisted of single dwellings. Villages of attached houses had watch towers, storerooms, and underground ceremonial chambers. The Spanish called their neat and compact settlements pueblos. These Native Americans thus were known as the Pueblo Indians. Some of their buildings were discovered by Anglo-American settlers in the late 19th century. The cliff dwellings and mesa top buildings that remain are very attractive.Spruce Tree House is the best preserved of Mesa Verde’s sites. This is a village containing 114 dwelling rooms and 8 kivas, which were ceremonial chambers. Many of the ceilings are made of timbered beams, cut poles and adobe.Cliff Palace is the biggest and best known of the ruins. The rooms accommodated 400 people and there is a four story tower. This was abandoned in the 13th century.Balcony House is another ruin, which is known for its defensive design. You have to climb a ladder up the canyon wall to a ledge to the court in the midst of the ancient dwellings. This all leads to the rear of the cave. The wall was built with careful stonework to safeguard the outer edge of the court. Pueblo Indians built it thousands of years ago because they didn’t like the idea of their children tumbling into the canyon. There is a crawl tunnel which is the only way out of the Balcony House. This was the only entrance for the Pueblos, a way to keep out invaders.There are hundreds more Cliff dwellings. Mesa Verdes Indians took to the caves late in their period of habitation, when raids of other Indians occurred. Earlier they lived in open sites atop the mesa and close to the farm lands and hunting areas. History suggests that bad farming, enemy pressure and a long drought in the 13th century led to the break up of their culture.There is a ruin called the Sun Temple which is on top of the mesa. This appears to have been built for religious purposes. There is a great mystery surrounding this ruin.There are some interesting facts about the Basketmakers who lived in Mesa Verde from A.D. 1-400. These agricultural Indians wove beautiful baskets, but built no houses, made no pots, and had no bows and arrows. The major weapon was an atlatl. It was a very primitive throwing stick that increased the power of their throwing arms. It was inaccurate and short ranged, and so was not good for hunting or defense. They gradually learned to make roofed houses, and to make pots to cook with.Canyon de Chelly National MonumentIn Northeastern Arizona, three broad irregular canyons come together to form a leaf shaped scar. They are Canyon de Chelly, Canyon del Muerto, and Monument Canyon. All three cut deeply into the plateau with vertical walls of red sandstone. Their wide level floors are dry and sandy, and most of the year rain turns them into muddy torrents. Together the three canyons make up Canyon de Chelly National Monument. This symbolizes an ancient and traditional home of the Navajo Indians. They have lived in the canyon since about 1700. Their houses, or hogans, and peach orchards can be seen scattered on the canyon floor. This land has come to be known as the sacred land of the Navajos.This is the largest and most scenic national archeological monument. There are several hundred ruins, but the principal ones are White House and Sliding, in twenty five mile Canyon de Chelly. The earliest construction of the White House Ruin began about 1066. The ruin originally contained about 175 rooms and 4 kivas. The kivas were used for ceremonial chambers. The Basketmakers are said to have lived there during the Pueblo period 1276-1299; then they parted.The White Man’s world has really interfered with the Navajo way of life. This began with the Spaniards that roamed the southwest. After one raid in 1804, Spanish troops followed the Navajos into this canyon stronghold. They killed women and children by firing against the roof in a high cave, so that their bullets ricocheted into them. In Canyon del Muerto lead spots can still be seen on the ceiling of that cave. It is known as the Canyon of Death.In 1864, the famous frontiersman, Kit Carson, took some Navajos and put them on a reserve in New Mexico. Carson and his men caught about 8,000 Indians in Canyon de Chelly and herded them off to Bosque Redondo. So many Indians died in that concentration camp that the government relented and let them return; and the Navajo have lived there ever since. They have a huge reservation which still exists.The three canyons sheltered the Anasazi, and the Ancient Ones, centuries before the first Navajo came.Mummy Cave, in Canyon del Muerto, has a well preserved dwelling with a three story watch tower made of smooth cut masonry. This cave was thought by archeologists to be inhabited from about the time that Christ was born to 1300. This village may have been inhabited longer than any other in the United States. Antelope House and Standing Cow are both ancient cliff dwellings that are named for Navajo paintings which are still on the canyon walls. One of the pre-Columbian sites is White House Ruin in Canyon de Chelly. This name of this dwelling comes from its white plaster, which is made from adobe; the building remains preserved today.Monument ValleyMonument Valley is a beautiful place. It stretches across northern Arizona’s plateau country and into southern Utah. It is known by some as the land of the Navajo Indians. Masses of time-chiseled rocks resembling temples form a stone city. Great red sandstone columns and carved forms reach upward to heights of over one thousand feet. The unusual outlines of some of the formations have been given names such as Emperor on the Throne, Train Rock, the Camel, and Elephant Herd. It is said to be the finest architecture in the world.The great sandstone figures resemble human forms, animals, birds, and other familiar objects. At night the rising of the moon lights up the valley beautifully. This gives the monuments a fairyland effect. Sometimes in the morning the cloud formations appear as a fog covering the valley floor, making the tops of the monuments look as though they are suspended in mid-air.From a central point in Monument Valley, the Ute Mountains in Colorado, the Henrys in Utah, the Carrizos in New Mexico, and the Lukachukais in Arizona can all be seen. The four mountain ranges are all within a radius of 250 miles.The elevation of Monument Valley is 4,500 feet above sea level. The valley has the San Juan River in Utah on the north of it. The south gateway is the Owl Rock and Ogathla Peak, which is in Arizona. The eastern side is Comb Ridge near the Colorado state line. On the west is No Man’s Mesa and Copper Canyon in Utah.At one time, Monument Valley was a level area. Volcanic eruptions caused the earth to crack. Erosion by wind and water took place, and the sandstone sections formed hundreds of monuments. Many were topped with limestone. Prehistoric people found the area suitable to build pueblos and cliff dwellings. Great ruins are still there under the ledges of cliffs in some areas. They were built of mud and stone.Monument Valley comprises a small section of the 25,000 square miles of the Navajo nation. This is the largest Indian reservation in the United States. There are Navajo families presently living there. The Navajo in Monument Valley do not live in villages, as do the Hopi, whose small reservation is contained in this area. The Navajo are a pastoral people who move from place to place. As their flocks graze onward, they just build new homes. They have two different types of homes: summer and winter. Their winter homes are a low dome shaped mud and brush house built over logs. It resembles an igloo. The space inside is roomy and comfortable. The fire for heating and cooking is built in the center of the room, with a smoke hole in the top of the hogan. The summer shelter looks like an open air camp. The roof is thatched and supported by poles and is open on all sides. It serves as a shelter from the summer sun. The winter hogans are usually built on a mesa or behind a hill, near a spring. This is used year after year until it is abandoned or burned, due to a death in the family. The summer hogans are moved from field to field. The entrance is always facing the east, because the Navajo is a sun worshipper.This mesa country is adapted to sheep raising. The Navajo shear the sheep for rug weaving and for trading purposes. All families raise sheep and grow corn, melons, squash, and beans for their own needs.There is a world of discovery in this land of monuments. There are buttes, mesas, canyons and free standing rock formations that appear to defy gravity.This hot and arrid environment limits human occupation. There are more than 100 sites and ruins dating back before 1300 A.D. It is not known as to when the first Navajo settled in the valley. Recent literature of the Navajo lands has given this area the title of Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park. The Navajo National and Recreation Department gives out information for visiting this area.Sample Lesson PLans1. Make Navajo Fry Bread1 cup flour      1 tsp. baking powder      1/2 tsp. salt1/2 cup water      8-10 tablespoons solid shortening for fryinghoney      jamTo begin, sift flour, baking powder and salt in a bowl. Stir in the water, mix with your fingers; the children will love this part. Knead lightly by digging in with the heel of your hand. This will make a soft dough.Dust everything with flour, if the dough is sticky. Roll out the dough 1/4 inch thick on a lightly floured surface. Cut into squares, about 2 inches.Melt the shortening in a sauce pan. When it is hot and smoking, quickly fry 2-3 squares of dough at a time. They will puff up. Brown one side, then the other. You can drain on paper. This can be served with honey or jam.Children love to cook and eat their creations. This activity is simple and the rewards are immediate. The children will gain a sense of how the Indians used to eat. The simpler the method, the more interest you will generate in the children.2. Kachina DollsThese were masks that were used to summon spirits. The Indians would wear the huge head masks and go to a village and dance for the people. They brought gifts and taught people arts and crafts. The masks would resemble animals, birds, vegetables and many reptiles. The Hopi, Zuni and the Navajo used these masks as a ceremonial costume.Children love to make colorful and wild masks for any occasion. Use lots of bright paper, scissors, glue, scraps of old material, colorful yarn, and let the children use their imaginations.I would suggest that you have a Kachina doll already made to use as an example. Try it on, and let the children wear it to get rid of any fears and anxiety about making them.3. Creating a loom____You will need:____14 inches long—12 inches wide of heavy cardboard____scissors   ruler   1 tapestry needle   beads (clay, wooden)____35-40 yards of colorful yarn (lots of bright colors)____1 ball of 2 ply juteUsing a ruler, draw a line 1/2 inch down from the top of the cardboard. Now, draw the same amount on the bottom of the cardboard. Now, cut on the 1/2 inch lines from the edge of the cardboard, to the lines that you drew on the top and the bottom. Do not bend the cardboard. There should be 24 tabs at the top and the bottom. String the threads, or the warp, as it is called. Use the ball of jute. Hold the cardboard so that the cuts are at the top and bottom. Take one end of the jute, push it down from the top firmly into the first cut. The loose end should stick out of the back on the left. Wind the jute around the second tab three or four times. (Follow the diagram I have drawn.) As a final step, students weave yarn crosswise over and under yarn already on cardboard. Children love to weave, especially if they have a choice of bright colors. Let them choose their own combinations, and make sure you have one that is done so that they can see the finished product.(figure available in print form)Some follow up lessons:A. Correspond with an Indian reservation in the regions that you discussed. See if you could create a pen pal situation with the schools that they have there. Write to the following place for information: Four Corners U.S.A. Teec Nos Pos Chapter. P.O. Box 949, Teec Nos Pos, Arizona, 86514. The children love to hear how other cultures live, especially in the U.S.A.B. Children also enjoy music and dance of other cultures. Have a person from The Turtle Island Store in New Haven come into the classroom for a visit. One of the owners does ritual dances and is quite friendly. She has been on the New Haven Green for creating a drum circle dance. This can be performed in a classroom and can be very stimulating for the children and the adults. You may want to have the children make their own drums before having a guest. Mixashawn is another New Haven Jazz Musician who is very willing to perform for small audiences. He is an audience response person, so the children will not be bored.C. Recreate the ruins and land formations. Using clay or shoe boxes, create dioramas. Children can be shown pictures of the places that you read about. Let them use their imaginations and have an exhibit showing all their hard work. Given hands on work, the children tend to produce creations you would never expect.D. Have a fashion show of Indian dress. Some children are very good at drawing and designing. Let them reproduce the way it used to be years ago, and let them design the outfits nowadays. The Indians tend to be very colorful and children respond to this.To put closure on all these activities, have a combination day and invite people from the school to visit. The students can exhibit everything that they made, and be very proud that people were interested to look at it.Bibliography1.

I would like to use a holistic approach to teaching this unit. The children have very little experience in the following areas: map skills, origin of the states, regional cultural differences and similarities, and the historical landmarks that exist in our world today. I would like the children to use their creative side of the brain. An experiential, hands-on approach to teaching this unit is suggested, since most children tend to lose interest quickly unless stimulated to learn.The curriculum can be used for kindergarten through eighth graders. My population consists of fifth to seventh graders in a special education classroom. They range from non-readers to fourth grade readers. These students are fascinated by drama, music, art, dance, imagery and affective educational learning techniques.After this unit is completed, I intend to discuss a unit on the Quinnipiac Indians of New Haven. There are many Indian landmarks to explore in our area. This would provide for a very real closure activity.The area I will be focusing on will be the Four Corners Region of the United States. This area is comprised of Utah, New Mexico, Arizona and Colorado. The children of New Haven know about their surroundings; this unit will allow them to venture out of New Haven upon unknown territory. They have no knowledge of the distance of the United States; this unit will provide some meaningful experiences as to our whereabouts as compared to the states in the United States.Long before Columbus first saw America, this land was occupied by Indians. They lived here for about 1300 years until they were driven out by a long drought which lasted years. However, the Indians left stories behind them without having anything written. Archeologists read by studying the baskets, pottery, weapons and dwellings of the ancient inhabitants. These remnants of a past civilization have been well preserved.Children can become amateur archeologists and learn more about our earlier cultures in a land that still exists.HISTORICAL OVERVIEWArizonaThe name Arizona comes from an Indian word meaning “Arizonac” or Little Spring. It is a big state in the Southwestern United States. Throughout Arizona you can see relics of ancient people. In 1863, Arizona was made into a territory. It was a land filled with gold mines and Indians, and people came there looking for metals such as gold, silver and copper.Arizona is known as the Grand Canyon state. Most of the land is high, flat land gouged out by canyons; it is considered a plateau region filled with mountains.There are Indian nations in this land that are almost a thousand years old. The Hopi and Navajo are just two of these nations living there now. Much of Arizona is desert land with cactus plants. These plants can live up to five years without rainfall since they store juices for the time when there is no rain. These cactus bloom in the spring and bear fruit in the summer. The actual state flower of Arizona is the white flower from a sequaro cactus plant.Various animals live in Arizona, including mountain lions, bobcats, deer, black bears, foxes and antelopes. The pack rat is quite unique because he steals things but in return leaves a pine cone or piece of cactus. Snakes, scorpions, tarantulas and many kinds of lizards exist in the Arizona desert.Throughout Arizona you can see the influence Mexicans have had on this area. This influence is reflected in buildings, foods, festivals, and schools which teach Spanish as well as English. Indians are also a large population in Arizona. Many of Arizona’s Indian nations have lived there for hundreds of years on reservations. Some live modern lifestyles, and some follow the traditional ones of long ago. The Navajo are an Indian nation of Arizona who are famous for making rugs that are weaved, and blankets. They are also very good business people. There are also Hopi Indians living in a village that is said to be over 800 years old. The Hopi village of Oraibi may be the oldest American town. It was started in 1200 A.D. and people still live there.New MexicoNew Mexico is the 47th state and was established on January 6, 1912. The capital is Santa Fe, and the state is called the Land of Enchantment. Most of New Mexico’s land consists of high plateaus or mesas, mountain ranges, canyons, valleys and dry arroyos.New Mexico is one of only four states whose water flows into three major river systems. The most important river in the state is the Rio Grande, which flows clear across New Mexico to become one of the five major river systems of the United States. New Mexico is dry and has elevated surfaces that were once covered with water. Much of the land was raised or lowered by forces from below. Mountain ranges were formed, but seas swept in and wore down the area. Then, in the west and northwest areas of the state, came volcanic activity. Volcanic ash accumulated and flows of lava poured out over the land. As the land continued to rise, parts of the region became mountains. The country’s biggest range, the Rocky Mountains, was formed. During the Ice Age glaciers covered the peaks of mountains, valleys were shaped, and canyons were cut.A wide variety of fossils of animals have been found in present day New Mexico. These include fish, reptiles, and dinosaurs.New Mexico is often known as the Sunshine State. The sun shines as much in winter as in the summer. Clean air, high mountains, level prairies, valleys and fields make New Mexico quite unique.The ancient people of New Mexico have been among the most studied anywhere. Things they left behind thousands of years ago tell the story of the land. Some of the oldest remains of people have been found there. Cave dwellers roamed the area, and the Basketmakers were a group of people that came in next. They hunted and raised crops, and built houses which were sunk below the level of the ground. The Pueblo people invented villages and houses that resembled our condominiums, architecturally, and systems of irrigation were developed. Arts and crafts, pumpkin growing, and weaving and pottery were all practiced. Indian art on walls and caves tells of the historical events in New Mexico. The Pueblo were a peaceful group of people. The Navajo acquainted themselves with the Pueblo. The two cultures shared different styles of living.Life in New Mexico now is influenced by three cultures. They are Indian, Spanish, and English-speaking Americans. The architecture reflects Indian Pueblo and Spanish styles. The area is still known for woodcarving, talented weavers, and for fine Spanish food.UtahUtah is west of the Great Divide and halfway between Canada and Mexico. It is the 11th largest state in the United States. Arizona borders it on the south, Nevada on the west, Idaho and Wyoming on the north, and Wyoming and Colorado are on the east. At the southwest corner is the only spot in the United States where the four states meet.In 1776, Spanish missionaries opened the route for the Old Spanish Trail. This was between Santa Fe and Utah Lake. The Ute Indians lived in this region. The word “Ute”, which means people of the mountains, became the name of the state. There were several large tribes that made up the Ute Nation. Then came the Paiutes, and Shoshone Indians.John C. Fremont, in 1843-44, made an expedition to Oregon and went to Great Salt Lake Valley. He was the first to make maps and report on this region. In 1844, Brigham Young became leader of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This was a religious group known as the Mormons. For years, the Mormons were driven from state to state. People didn’t approve of the Mormons’ beliefs and ways of life. Brigham Young headed for Utah in 1846 with a small group of Mormons. They built cabins, planted crops, and found a new home. Brigham Young tried to set up a government, but between the Ute Indians and President Fillmore, it failed.In 1848, a group of hungry crickets started eating the crops and starvation occurred. A flock of seagulls appeared and ate the crickets. Some years later, the Mormons put up a Sea Gull Monument on Temple Square in Salt Lake City. These birds are protected by law because they were so helpful.On January 4, 1896, Utah became the 45th state. It is the eleventh largest state in the United States. The capital is Salt Lake City, and the nickname for the state is the beehive state. It is known for its industry. The state tree is the Blue Spruce and the flower is the Sego Lily.Utah is quite a unique state. The Wasatch Mountains form a spine down the middle of the state. West of the mountains is a green band of land fertile from irrigation, and west of this band is a section of desert. This large area in Western Utah is called the Great Basin, and in the south end of the basin is Utah Lake, the largest fresh water lake in the state.East of the Wasatch Mountains is the Colorado Plateau. This is a desert area that changes from yellow to red as it nears the Colorado River. Mountains and plateaus make up most of the state. Utah is one of the largest silver producing states in the nation. Petroleum, lead, and zinc are taken from the Utah mines. The Mormons learned about coal and how it burned from the Indians. This helped Utah become a prosperous coal industry state.ColoradoThe beautiful state of Colorado sits on top of the world. It is known as the highest state in the union. One thousand five hundred peaks in this state tower ten thousand feet or more above sea level. These snow-capped Rocky Mountains are the most striking feature of Colorado. This divides the state into two sections. On the east side of the mountains, rivers flow east into the Mississippi Valley. On the west, they flow west into the Pacific Ocean. Because they separate the rivers in this way, the Rocky Mountains’ peaks are called the Continental Divide.Colorado lies about halfway between Canada on the north and Mexico on the south. The state is shaped like a rectangle and covers 103,948 square miles.It is believed that Coronado was the first white man to exist in the Colorado area. He came in 1541. He was a famous Spaniard seeking the seven cities of Cibola and their treasures of gold. In 1706, another Spanish explorer, Juan de Uribarri, took possession of the region. He did this in the name of Spain, and called it Santo Domingo. Over the next hundred years, France and Spain fought each other for possession of this area. In 1803, the United States bought this territory from France. This was called the Louisiana Purchase, and cost 15 million dollars. After all the explorers, hunters and trappers came to the region of Colorado.The first settlement in Colorado was in 1853. Six years later the first school was opened in Auraria. It was a one room log cabin with a mud roof. In 1858 gold was discovered in the streams far into the mountains. In a few years the gold disappeared. Families settled on the river valley and began planting crops and establishing farms.In 1867, the capital became Denver. Bridges were put up, roads were built, and the Denver and Rio Grande railroad was developed. On August 1, 1876, Colorado was admitted to the Union as the 38th state.The mild climate and sunshine help the farmers in Colorado grow wheat, corn, hay and alfalfa. Colorado also leads the nation in the growing of sugar beets.Coal is the chief mineral product of Colorado today. The large coal mines supply fuel for many industries, including the giant steel mills. This mountain state also has a supply of building materials, such as granite, marble and sandstone. Limestone and lava are mined here and sent all over.Colorado has forests of pine, fir, and spruce which cover millions of acres. In order to preserve the trees, the government set aside thirteen million acres as national forests. They cover one-fifth of the state.Denver lies just north of the center of the state. It is the largest city in Colorado and is named the Queen city of the Plains because of the business and tourist center located there. The State Museum Building contains relics of the Pueblo Indians and the Cliff Dwellers of long ago. It also shows the development of transportation in the west.Some cities of Colorado hold lots of historical artifacts. Pueblo, a city of factories and steel mills, is 40 miles south of Colorado Springs. It is the second largest city in the state, and its history goes back to the Spanish days. In 1806, Lieutenant Zebulon Pike erected the first building built by Americans in Colorado. Pueblo has been filled with trappers, hunters, and people seeking gold. It is a city filled with many races and nationalities. In Trinidad, a city in the extreme southern part of Colorado, lies the Kit Carson Museum which contains pioneer relics.Mesa VerdeMesa Verde is a park in the southwestern corner of Colorado. Since it is covered by plateau evergreens, juniper and pinion, the Spanish named it Mesa Verde, meaning Green Table. This park protects one of the most impressive groups of prehistoric Indian structures north of Mexico. The ancient buildings are set in a wilderness of forested canyons and mesas, too. There are villages such as Cliff Palace, Spruce Tree House, and Square Tower House. According to archeologists, the primitive civilization started at the beginning of the first century A.D. and continued to the 13th century.During the Basketmakers period A.D. to 450, the Indians raised squash and corn on the mesas and lived in caves. During the next 300 years, the Indians discovered how to make pottery, along with baskets. They also developed a new kind of dwelling, shallow pits dug in the mesas’ tops and roofed with poles covered with mud. During the Developmental Pueblo Period, which was from 750-1100, the Indians used different methods of constructing walls of stone, mud, and poles. Then they began joining their houses to form villages. Up to this time there had been peace, and the Indians progressed in the following areas: arts and crafts, population, and farming.Prehistoric Indians farmed the Mesa Verde for over a thousand years. Their structures consisted of single dwellings. Villages of attached houses had watch towers, storerooms, and underground ceremonial chambers. The Spanish called their neat and compact settlements pueblos. These Native Americans thus were known as the Pueblo Indians. Some of their buildings were discovered by Anglo-American settlers in the late 19th century. The cliff dwellings and mesa top buildings that remain are very attractive.Spruce Tree House is the best preserved of Mesa Verde’s sites. This is a village containing 114 dwelling rooms and 8 kivas, which were ceremonial chambers. Many of the ceilings are made of timbered beams, cut poles and adobe.Cliff Palace is the biggest and best known of the ruins. The rooms accommodated 400 people and there is a four story tower. This was abandoned in the 13th century.Balcony House is another ruin, which is known for its defensive design. You have to climb a ladder up the canyon wall to a ledge to the court in the midst of the ancient dwellings. This all leads to the rear of the cave. The wall was built with careful stonework to safeguard the outer edge of the court. Pueblo Indians built it thousands of years ago because they didn’t like the idea of their children tumbling into the canyon. There is a crawl tunnel which is the only way out of the Balcony House. This was the only entrance for the Pueblos, a way to keep out invaders.There are hundreds more Cliff dwellings. Mesa Verdes Indians took to the caves late in their period of habitation, when raids of other Indians occurred. Earlier they lived in open sites atop the mesa and close to the farm lands and hunting areas. History suggests that bad farming, enemy pressure and a long drought in the 13th century led to the break up of their culture.There is a ruin called the Sun Temple which is on top of the mesa. This appears to have been built for religious purposes. There is a great mystery surrounding this ruin.There are some interesting facts about the Basketmakers who lived in Mesa Verde from A.D. 1-400. These agricultural Indians wove beautiful baskets, but built no houses, made no pots, and had no bows and arrows. The major weapon was an atlatl. It was a very primitive throwing stick that increased the power of their throwing arms. It was inaccurate and short ranged, and so was not good for hunting or defense. They gradually learned to make roofed houses, and to make pots to cook with.Canyon de Chelly National MonumentIn Northeastern Arizona, three broad irregular canyons come together to form a leaf shaped scar. They are Canyon de Chelly, Canyon del Muerto, and Monument Canyon. All three cut deeply into the plateau with vertical walls of red sandstone. Their wide level floors are dry and sandy, and most of the year rain turns them into muddy torrents. Together the three canyons make up Canyon de Chelly National Monument. This symbolizes an ancient and traditional home of the Navajo Indians. They have lived in the canyon since about 1700. Their houses, or hogans, and peach orchards can be seen scattered on the canyon floor. This land has come to be known as the sacred land of the Navajos.This is the largest and most scenic national archeological monument. There are several hundred ruins, but the principal ones are White House and Sliding, in twenty five mile Canyon de Chelly. The earliest construction of the White House Ruin began about 1066. The ruin originally contained about 175 rooms and 4 kivas. The kivas were used for ceremonial chambers. The Basketmakers are said to have lived there during the Pueblo period 1276-1299; then they parted.The White Man’s world has really interfered with the Navajo way of life. This began with the Spaniards that roamed the southwest. After one raid in 1804, Spanish troops followed the Navajos into this canyon stronghold. They killed women and children by firing against the roof in a high cave, so that their bullets ricocheted into them. In Canyon del Muerto lead spots can still be seen on the ceiling of that cave. It is known as the Canyon of Death.In 1864, the famous frontiersman, Kit Carson, took some Navajos and put them on a reserve in New Mexico. Carson and his men caught about 8,000 Indians in Canyon de Chelly and herded them off to Bosque Redondo. So many Indians died in that concentration camp that the government relented and let them return; and the Navajo have lived there ever since. They have a huge reservation which still exists.The three canyons sheltered the Anasazi, and the Ancient Ones, centuries before the first Navajo came.Mummy Cave, in Canyon del Muerto, has a well preserved dwelling with a three story watch tower made of smooth cut masonry. This cave was thought by archeologists to be inhabited from about the time that Christ was born to 1300. This village may have been inhabited longer than any other in the United States. Antelope House and Standing Cow are both ancient cliff dwellings that are named for Navajo paintings which are still on the canyon walls. One of the pre-Columbian sites is White House Ruin in Canyon de Chelly. This name of this dwelling comes from its white plaster, which is made from adobe; the building remains preserved today.Monument ValleyMonument Valley is a beautiful place. It stretches across northern Arizona’s plateau country and into southern Utah. It is known by some as the land of the Navajo Indians. Masses of time-chiseled rocks resembling temples form a stone city. Great red sandstone columns and carved forms reach upward to heights of over one thousand feet. The unusual outlines of some of the formations have been given names such as Emperor on the Throne, Train Rock, the Camel, and Elephant Herd. It is said to be the finest architecture in the world.The great sandstone figures resemble human forms, animals, birds, and other familiar objects. At night the rising of the moon lights up the valley beautifully. This gives the monuments a fairyland effect. Sometimes in the morning the cloud formations appear as a fog covering the valley floor, making the tops of the monuments look as though they are suspended in mid-air.From a central point in Monument Valley, the Ute Mountains in Colorado, the Henrys in Utah, the Carrizos in New Mexico, and the Lukachukais in Arizona can all be seen. The four mountain ranges are all within a radius of 250 miles.The elevation of Monument Valley is 4,500 feet above sea level. The valley has the San Juan River in Utah on the north of it. The south gateway is the Owl Rock and Ogathla Peak, which is in Arizona. The eastern side is Comb Ridge near the Colorado state line. On the west is No Man’s Mesa and Copper Canyon in Utah.At one time, Monument Valley was a level area. Volcanic eruptions caused the earth to crack. Erosion by wind and water took place, and the sandstone sections formed hundreds of monuments. Many were topped with limestone. Prehistoric people found the area suitable to build pueblos and cliff dwellings. Great ruins are still there under the ledges of cliffs in some areas. They were built of mud and stone.Monument Valley comprises a small section of the 25,000 square miles of the Navajo nation. This is the largest Indian reservation in the United States. There are Navajo families presently living there. The Navajo in Monument Valley do not live in villages, as do the Hopi, whose small reservation is contained in this area. The Navajo are a pastoral people who move from place to place. As their flocks graze onward, they just build new homes. They have two different types of homes: summer and winter. Their winter homes are a low dome shaped mud and brush house built over logs. It resembles an igloo. The space inside is roomy and comfortable. The fire for heating and cooking is built in the center of the room, with a smoke hole in the top of the hogan. The summer shelter looks like an open air camp. The roof is thatched and supported by poles and is open on all sides. It serves as a shelter from the summer sun. The winter hogans are usually built on a mesa or behind a hill, near a spring. This is used year after year until it is abandoned or burned, due to a death in the family. The summer hogans are moved from field to field. The entrance is always facing the east, because the Navajo is a sun worshipper.This mesa country is adapted to sheep raising. The Navajo shear the sheep for rug weaving and for trading purposes. All families raise sheep and grow corn, melons, squash, and beans for their own needs.There is a world of discovery in this land of monuments. There are buttes, mesas, canyons and free standing rock formations that appear to defy gravity.This hot and arrid environment limits human occupation. There are more than 100 sites and ruins dating back before 1300 A.D. It is not known as to when the first Navajo settled in the valley. Recent literature of the Navajo lands has given this area the title of Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park. The Navajo National and Recreation Department gives out information for visiting this area.Sample Lesson PLans1. Make Navajo Fry Bread1 cup flour      1 tsp. baking powder      1/2 tsp. salt1/2 cup water      8-10 tablespoons solid shortening for fryinghoney      jamTo begin, sift flour, baking powder and salt in a bowl. Stir in the water, mix with your fingers; the children will love this part. Knead lightly by digging in with the heel of your hand. This will make a soft dough.Dust everything with flour, if the dough is sticky. Roll out the dough 1/4 inch thick on a lightly floured surface. Cut into squares, about 2 inches.Melt the shortening in a sauce pan. When it is hot and smoking, quickly fry 2-3 squares of dough at a time. They will puff up. Brown one side, then the other. You can drain on paper. This can be served with honey or jam.Children love to cook and eat their creations. This activity is simple and the rewards are immediate. The children will gain a sense of how the Indians used to eat. The simpler the method, the more interest you will generate in the children.2. Kachina DollsThese were masks that were used to summon spirits. The Indians would wear the huge head masks and go to a village and dance for the people. They brought gifts and taught people arts and crafts. The masks would resemble animals, birds, vegetables and many reptiles. The Hopi, Zuni and the Navajo used these masks as a ceremonial costume.Children love to make colorful and wild masks for any occasion. Use lots of bright paper, scissors, glue, scraps of old material, colorful yarn, and let the children use their imaginations.I would suggest that you have a Kachina doll already made to use as an example. Try it on, and let the children wear it to get rid of any fears and anxiety about making them.3. Creating a loom____You will need:____14 inches long—12 inches wide of heavy cardboard____scissors   ruler   1 tapestry needle   beads (clay, wooden)____35-40 yards of colorful yarn (lots of bright colors)____1 ball of 2 ply juteUsing a ruler, draw a line 1/2 inch down from the top of the cardboard. Now, draw the same amount on the bottom of the cardboard. Now, cut on the 1/2 inch lines from the edge of the cardboard, to the lines that you drew on the top and the bottom. Do not bend the cardboard. There should be 24 tabs at the top and the bottom. String the threads, or the warp, as it is called. Use the ball of jute. Hold the cardboard so that the cuts are at the top and bottom. Take one end of the jute, push it down from the top firmly into the first cut. The loose end should stick out of the back on the left. Wind the jute around the second tab three or four times. (Follow the diagram I have drawn.) As a final step, students weave yarn crosswise over and under yarn already on cardboard. Children love to weave, especially if they have a choice of bright colors. Let them choose their own combinations, and make sure you have one that is done so that they can see the finished product.(figure available in print form)Some follow up lessons:A. Correspond with an Indian reservation in the regions that you discussed. See if you could create a pen pal situation with the schools that they have there. Write to the following place for information: Four Corners U.S.A. Teec Nos Pos Chapter. P.O. Box 949, Teec Nos Pos, Arizona, 86514. The children love to hear how other cultures live, especially in the U.S.A.B. Children also enjoy music and dance of other cultures. Have a person from The Turtle Island Store in New Haven come into the classroom for a visit. One of the owners does ritual dances and is quite friendly. She has been on the New Haven Green for creating a drum circle dance. This can be performed in a classroom and can be very stimulating for the children and the adults. You may want to have the children make their own drums before having a guest. Mixashawn is another New Haven Jazz Musician who is very willing to perform for small audiences. He is an audience response person, so the children will not be bored.C. Recreate the ruins and land formations. Using clay or shoe boxes, create dioramas. Children can be shown pictures of the places that you read about. Let them use their imaginations and have an exhibit showing all their hard work. Given hands on work, the children tend to produce creations you would never expect.D. Have a fashion show of Indian dress. Some children are very good at drawing and designing. Let them reproduce the way it used to be years ago, and let them design the outfits nowadays. The Indians tend to be very colorful and children respond to this.To put closure on all these activities, have a combination day and invite people from the school to visit. The students can exhibit everything that they made, and be very proud that people were interested to look at it.Bibliography1.

Story of Rainier - Article XXIII - Lodges--(Concluded)<<<PreviousArticleTable of ContentsT H E   S T O R Y   OF    R A I N I E R1 8 0 5  1 9 2 5 ARTICLE XXIIILodges--(Concluded) The Ladies of the Maccabees of the World were organized in Rainier on July 17, 1897.They met in the little, all-useful store building of Dean Blanchard, on what is now thecorner at East Fifth and A streets, effected their organization and elected officers. The first officers from this charter list were: Mrs. Victoria A. Perry, past ladycommander; Mrs. Edith E. Clark, lady commander; Mrs. Emily Dryden, lady lieutenantcommander; Miss Anna Belle Perry, lady record keeper; Mrs. Alice Gilbreath, lady Financekeeper; Mrs. Veronica Herman, lady chaplain; Mrs. Etta Huycke, lady at arms; Miss HollisShatto, lady sergeant, Mrs. Mary J. Pomeroy, lady sentinel; Mrs. Julia M. Both, ladypicket. According to the record that I have, Miss Caroline E. Pomeroy was the only memberof the charter list who was not an officer. This organization since then has been changed to the Women's Benefit Association ofMaccabees. Its review, number 20, is still an active organization in Rainier. In the following year, Ivy Camp 373, Woodmen of the World, was instituted. The charterlist for this lodge consisted of: Charles A. Burch, George Buckbee, C.L. Clark, A.L.Clark, W.J. Deitz, W.H. Dryden, Philip Drouth, H.L. Groves, R.G. Johnson, James Jesse,E.A. James, G.W. Gordon, S.H. Kistner, A.B. Little, W.E. Newsom, C.C. Pritchard, ThomasPatton, E.H. Philbrook, A. Parker, G.A. Riggs, W.M. Riggs, J.A. Schunesen, J. Cy Smith,F.J. Sundblom, J.J. Schmidt. The charter was granted on February 22, 1898, with officers as follows: Consul, T.H.Woodruff; escort, W.H. Dryden; advisor, S.H. Kistner; watchman, A.A. Johnson; banker, J.R.Caldwell; sentry, C.F. Willis; clerk, J. Cy Smith; physician, A.P. McLaren; managers, E.A.Anfys, Philip Drout, W.J. Deitz. Women of Woodcraft, Riverside Circle 315, was instituted on November 21,1900. This isan auxiliary to the Woodmen of the World. The charter officers were: Annie Schunesen,adviser; Margaret G. Aaron, magician; Flora G. Marquit, past guardian neighbor; George B.Hallin, clerk; Flora J. Shelton, attendant; Emily A. Dryden, inner sentinel; Nannie B.Goff, guardian neighbor; Evelyn E. Woodruff, banker; Mrs. Burt Deitz, captain of theguards; Dr. M.K. Hall, outer sentinel; managers, Emma F. Spinney, Nina B. Haggin, Alta M.Lee. Following the "Woodmen of the World and Riverside Circle", the Odd Fellowslodge was next in Rainier. Lodge 151, I.O.O.F., was instituted on March 2, 1901, following a dispensation grantedon February 23 of the same year. The charter list was small, containing but six names:J.J. Schmidt, W.J. Deitz, Rosswell R. Patch, U.C. Adams, L.E. Clark, S.C. Rich. Though itsbeginning was small, the Odd Fellows lodge has grown to the place where it is now one ofthe largest lodges in Rainier. On May 19, 1904, Fern Rebekah Lodge 133 was instituted, with eleven charterpetitioners: W.C. Fischer, Wm. Symons, Lewis Brant, R.H. Mitchell, A.L. Clark, G.A.Taggert, Eva Brant, Mary J. Clark, Edith E. Clark, Emily Mitchell, Eleanor Symons. Columbia Encampment 89, another branch of the Odd Fellows lodge, was instituted on May22, 1923, with 20 members, and, on December 23 of the same year, Columbia Canton 19 wasinstituted with 15 members. Of the later lodges, the Moose lodge is the newest in Rainier. Lodge 1435, L.O.O.M.,was instituted October 8, 1913, with a charter list of fifty members--the largest by farof any lodge previously launched in Rainier. This list is as follows: Lee Clark, FredBenjamin, R. Touzel, C.F. Tucker, C. Crawford, John Larson, A. Burke, L.E. Clark, C.C.Fowler. W.B. Smith, W.C. Parker, Harry C. Smith, P.C. Evans, Andrew Lee, Ray Elbon, C.A.Nutt, Charles Hallirian, Vic Frirer, E.J. Remy, G.B. Graham, W. Oberg, C.M. Fowler,Charles Rainer, Miles Sheerin. W.A. Rader, W. Curran, C.A. Parker, C.T. Bross, E.O.Brough, Joseph Keeley, Harry L. Elbon, George Anderson, John Mauris, John Orn, P. Leallen,S. Styke, C. Murphy, George Weaver, John Kinamas, Frank Sherwood, William Mauris, O.Nelson, F.M. McDonald, H.S. Schroeder, W.E. Welch, Eric Wilson, Walter Hunter, E.S.Cochran, J.R. Nutbrown, Thomas Hunter. The Moose lodge lost its charter in the fire on the morning of June 28.1924, andanother was issued on July 18, of the same year. Women of Mooseheart Chapter 90 was instituted in Rainier on May 28, 1923. This is thelatest of the lodge additions. It is safe to say that Rainier almost never was without a lodge, for the Masonic lodgecame here in 1858, which was but a very few years after the opening chapters of Rainier'sknown history started. Following that time, of course, the Masonic lodge was the only oneuntil 1893, so far as any record goes that I have had access to, but after that time thelodges came in rapid succession. It is rather doubtful if there are many towns of the sizeof Rainier where there is such a large lodge membership as there is here.

ImageCLEF 2006 ImageCLEF2006Evaluation of image retrieval and annotation systems forphotographic and medical images IntroductionImageCLEF is the cross-languageimage retrieval track which is run as part of theCross Language Evaluation Forum(CLEF) campaign. This track evaluates retrieval of images described by textcaptions based on queries in a different language; both text and image matchingtechniques are potentially exploitable.

The tasks offer different and challenging retrieval problems forcross-language image retrieval. The first task is also envisaged as an entrylevel task for newcomers to CLEF and to CLIR. The main goals of ImageCLEF are toinvestigate the effectiveness of combining text and image for retrieval,collect and provide resources for benchmarking image retrieval systems andpromote the exchange of ideas which will lead to improvements in theperformance of retrieval systems. ImageCLEF is coordinatedby the University of Sheffield and the University and University Hospitals ofGeneva. Furthercontributors to ImageCLEF include Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU), Aachen University ofTechnology (RWTH) and the MUSCLE Networkof Excellence (NoE).

iWon -     iWon : Careers : Company Profiles : Glaxo Wellcome Glaxo Wellcome5 Moore Drive,Research Triangle Park,NC27709   www.glaxowellcome.com(919) 483-2100   Fax: (919) 483-0084  The Scoop Wellcome to the world Glaxo Wellcome (the U.S. subsidiary of Glaxo Wellcome PLC) may not sound like a household name, but the company's drugs have been welcomed by the world.  Founded as a baby food company in 1873 by Englishman Joseph Nathan, Glaxo Wellcome is no longer spoon-feeding British babies.  As the second-largest drug manufacturer in the world, Glaxo Wellcome PLC currently employs 55,000 people around the globe. Glaxo entered the pharmaceutical industry in 1927 with Ostelin, a liquid vitamin D concentrate, and produced penicillin and anesthetics during WWII.  The company went public in 1947, but it has experienced its greatest success since introducing the best-selling ulcer drug Zantac in 1981.  Another top seller is Retrovir, the most-prescribed AIDS treatment in the world, as well as a variety of prescription drugs for anesthesiology, bacterial infections, cardiology, dermatology, oncology, and respiratory diseases. Zantac wars In 1995 Glaxo made a $14.9 billion bid for Wellcome, a pharmaceutical company that led the world in antiviral medicines.  Wellcome brought Zovirax (antiviral), Retrovir (for AIDS), and Lamictic (for epilepsy) to the company, whose research and development costs were substantially reduced.  The following year, Glaxo sold its share in consumer ventures (Sudafed, Actifed, and Neosporin) to concentrate on developing prescription medicines.  Glaxo's success with the ulcer drug Zantac had been unparalleled in the pharmaceutical world; introduced in 1981, it quickly became the world's best selling prescription drug and remained on top for a full decade.  Global sales from Zantac reached $1.6 billion in 1996, but the loss of its patent in 1997 would be a bitter pill to swallow.  After fending off Novopharm Ltd. for six years, Glaxo lost its monopoly on Zantac when a U.S. federal appeals court ruled in favor of the competition.  Glaxo Wellcome predicted it would lose 80 to 90 percent of Zantac's sales to generic versions of the drug, but the company successfully compensated by diversifying its line of new products. Philly cheesesteaks vs. fish and chips In early-1998 the FDA approved the antidepressant Wellbutrin SR (sold as Zyban) for use as the first non-nicotine prescription anti-smoking drug.  That same year, Glaxo called off a $70 million merger with SmithKline Beecham, which would have created the largest pharmaceutical company in the world.  Neither company could produce a remedy for personal egos, however, with SmithKline fearing a hostile takeover and Glaxo unwilling to move company headquarters from London to Philadelphia.  When Bob Ingram was appointed CEO of Glaxo Wellcome in June 1998, he vowed to invest in R&D; to introduce three new drugs a year, beginning in the year 2000.  Ingram may yet get some help with his goal; rumors of the SmithKline merger were re-ignited in spring 1999 as its chief executive approaches retirement. A pharmaceutical Goliath  In January 2000, the long-anticipated merger finally began to look like a reality.  Glaxo announced that it would acquire SmithKline in a stock swap valued at $75.7 billion, instantly creating the world's largest drug company.  The merged entity would have about 7.3 percent of the worldwide prescription business.  The proposed company, to be called Glaxo SmithKline PLC, anticipates selling an increasing number of prescription drugs over the Internet.  And rivals beware: the company plans to "send a shiver down the spines" of competitors by exploiting their tremendous research and development capacities.  The deal still has to be evaluated by antitrust regulators in the U.S. and Europe, and the company will likely have to sell off some overlapping products.  The five-year itch In July 1998, Glaxo filed suit against the U.S. subsidiary of Teva Pharmaceuticals, claiming it used patented Glaxo technology to produce antidepressants.  One month later, Glaxo announced it was dissolving its over-the-counter joint venture with distributor Warner-Lambert, which had lasted five years.  Both companies gained flexibility from the divorce, with Glaxo regaining the rights to sell Zantac 75 (the over-the-counter version) outside the U.S. and in Canada.  Glaxo also received world rights to non-prescription forms of Zovirax and Beconase, as well as all future prescription products with over-the-counter versions.  In December 1998, Glaxo joined up with Ceuta Healthcare, which then began marketing Glaxo's top over-the-counter products. Looking ahead A new president and CEO took over Glaxo's U.S. subsidiary in January 1999.  George J. Morrow entered the company at a good time; U.S. sales were up 14 percent in 1998 despite overall decreases globally.  International sales in AIDS and migraine medications have been falling slowly, due to a decrease of AIDS cases in developed countries and more competition among migraine remedies.  At the end of 1998, Glaxo Wellcome acquired Amoun Pharmaceutical Industries for $117 million, becoming Egypt's largest pharmaceutical manufacturer.  Despite a recent rash of protests in the U.K. by animal activists, Glaxo Wellcome looks poised for continued success in the next millennium.  Effective Aug. 21, 2000, Glaxo Wellcome PLC will merge with SmithKline Beecham PLC to become Glaxo SmithKline PLC, the world's biggest drug maker. The $69.53 billion (46 billion pound, 72.93 billion euros) merger is expected to bring in $24.9 billion of annual sales for the new company, reflecting divested businesses. The joint business will have 107,000 employees and maintain leadership in vaccines and in the treatment of diseases ranging from AIDS to migraines. The merger is subject to shareholder approval, however. Getting Hired Now is "a GREAT time to get hired by Glaxo."  "Those downsizing days are over" and are being replaced by a new period of expansion and growth.  "The stressfulness of the interviewing process is very dependant upon the department in which you interview."  However, one insider remarked: "It was generally relaxed, most of it."  Glaxo interviewers "would like to know your personality, any relevant past experience, what your major interests are, what your expectations are."  For marketing positions, a "majority of the interviews are with people having an internal connection."  For computer and science departments, one techie offers this insight: "I would guess that it is 70 percent referral and 30 percent   applications to the company's HR department."  In other words, "referrals are definitely a way in."  Visit the Glaxo web site to find out more about the company and its departments.  Then, send a resume and a cover letter to Human Resources specifying the division of Glaxo in which you are interested.Our Survey Says Beyond Zantac "Glaxo is built into four separate divisions," including "Glaxo Pharmaceuticals (Zyban, Ceftin, Flovent), Boroughs Wellcome (same products, different promotions), Allan & Hanbury's (Serevent, Flovent, Flonase) and Cerenex (Imitrex, Wellbutrin SR, and Lamictal)."  While "there are other selling faces," these are the major units.  "For years, people thought Zantac was Glaxo, and to a certain extent it was," but the company has diversified the product line "to the extent that the loss of Zantac sales won't adversely affect the company."  Glaxo's growth Employees feel that Glaxo is "a very dynamic company with a lot of strong years," and is "probably among the best of the non-biotech companies."  Insiders describe Glaxo culture as "very fast moving and aggressive, but it is also informal and casual."  "The people in the company are very open and like to take calculated risks that can have big payoffs"  in the long run.  The company's management "avoids the top-down approach."  At Glaxo, "decisions on whom to call on, how often, etc., are pushed down as far as possible" in order to get as close to the customer as possible.  Job security is not a concern, as "Glaxo is growing." 900 reps were added in 1998 -- a 33 percent increase in staffing.  Glaxo continues to expand, "much to the amazement of many industry watchers."  Perks  Glaxo distinguishes itself as far as salary is concerned, with "bonuses as an integral part of overall pay." One Glaxo employee remarks that "if you are good at your job, you will make plenty of money."  For the Glaxo sales force, bonuses comprise "approximately 33 percent of total compensation."   "There is no shortage of funds for entertaining clients," and the sales team appreciates big expense accounts,  "nice cars to drive," and "lots of opportunities for trips to nice places."  Another bonus is autonomy: "Glaxo provides the information to allow one to determine who the key targets are." Employees also enjoy the benefits of on-site "fitness centers, child daycare, softball, tennis, and volleyball courts" and, naturally, "good health benefits."  In the company of women One employee reports that among his department, "all three senior managers are women."  The company promotes on "performance and potential, regardless of background."  Glaxo is "regularly featured" in Working Woman magazine as "one of the best places for women to work in the country."  Many at the company feel Glaxo "seems to treat everyone with equal respect," employing many women and minorities, "particularly in science."  However, one insider does remark that "If you look at the pictures of the board members and executive management, it is generally all white and male." On the job Glaxo hours are flexible. "You can come in anytime between 7 to 9 and leave between 4 to 6 with a one-hour lunch."  "We stress working hard, but also having a good time," says one Glaxo employee.  All in all, many seem to agree with one sales rep who put it this way: "I would not work for another pharmaceutical."Employment Contact  Human ResourcesProducts and Services Prescription and over-the-counter medicationsMore Company ProfilesFor more career information, go to Vault.com©2000, Vault.com Inc Click here to email this page to a friend   SEARCH ANOTHER COMPANYABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZSEARCH BY CATEGORYCareer guides and directoriesNon-profit jobsCareer publicationsSalary and benefits VAULT RESOURCESVault Message BoardsVault Member Directory #*# Vignette StoryServer 4 Thu Apr 20 18:04:17 2006 #*#HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"#*#iWon -     iWon : Careers#*# : #*#Company Profiles#*# : Glaxo Wellcome#*# #*#Glaxo Wellcome5 Moore Drive,Research Triangle Park,NC27709   www.glaxowellcome.com(919) 483-2100   Fax: (919) 483-0084  The Scoop Wellcome to the world Glaxo Wellcome (the U.S. subsidiary of Glaxo Wellcome PLC) may not sound like a household name, but the company's drugs have been welcomed by the world.

Most of them were completefailures, including Red Sonja and Legend, thoughLadyhawke actually managed to become a moderate success at thebox office. Director Richard Donner as an established force, the castwas filled with young stars and old favorites, and the story wasromantically set in a familiar medieval universe. That plot looselyinvolves a curse that has caused two lovers (Michelle Pfeiffer andRutger Hauer) to take the shape of animals against their will, one atnight and one during the day, so that they can never be together. Theirencounters saving the life (and utilizing the services) of a mousyMatthew Broderick provides the action. The film has a loyal cultfollowing even two decades later, and the project is a rare example of acircumstance in which it has always been controversial because of itsmusic. Donner had worked with both John Williams and Jerry Goldsmith,though with Williams on tour and taking a break from film scoring andGoldsmith mired in the disaster of Legend for Ridley Scott,Donner came up with the idea of combining the services of orchestratorAndrew Powell and taking advantage of the pop culture music fad invadingfantasy films at the time. It's hard to figure exactly where the genreswitched its allegiance from the robust orchestral fantasy scores ofWilliams, James Horner, Trevor Jones, and Basil Poledouris to the morecontemporary 1980's rock scene. Some point to Toto's strangely effectiveDune score in 1984 as the source. But in any case, 1985 fantasyfilms hastened the popular demise of the genre through this"popification." In the last gasps of the Conan franchise, EnnioMorricone would infuse his orchestral score with rock elements, whileGoldsmith's score for Legend would be tossed by the studio infavor of a Tangerine Dream replacement. And for Ladyhawke, Donnerand the producers reportedly heard music from the Alan Parsons Projectwhile scouting locations in Italy and decided to incorporate it as partof their film as well.The end result is one of the most widely mockedsoundtracks in the history of film. The Philharmonia Orchestra in Londonis largely supplanted by music directly out of the Alan Parsons Project,with the same musical producer and engineer for this film that alsoproduced "Dark Side of the Moon" by Pink Floyd, among others.Performances here include their normal guitarist, Ian Bairnson, as well.Powell never made a career of film scoring, before or afterLadyhawke, and the lack of experience in integrating theorchestral and rock elements of the score are its fatal flaw. Criticsactually laughed at the score in their reviews at the time, and reviewsof the movie's DVD release have been even less kind to the score due toits very aged sound. When describing the music of Alan Parsons, somepeople refer to it as cheesy disco holdovers from the 1980's, some usethe technically correct terminology of "80's progressive rock," and mostpeople write it off as "painful 80's synth crap." For collectors oftradition film scores, Ladyhawke is an insufferable tragedy andunsuccessfully begs to be forgiven as a blatant mistake of its era. Evena significant portion of Alan Parsons Project collectors going back tothe LPs of the early 80's find the score distracting in the film. And itcertainly is. There's nothing as bizarre as hearing 80's progressiverock in a sword and sorcery film, and what makes the situation inLadyhawke worse is that it's alternating with ten to fifteenminutes of really decent orchestral material by the London ensemble inthe film. You get bludgeoned by the 80's rock rhythms and electricguitars over cheesy keyboarding for the first half of the film, only tobe treated to some significantly rendered orchestral passages in thethird quarter, only to be slapped once again by the non-descript rock atthe end. The rock passages all sound alike, with the heartbeat effectfrom "Dark Side of the Moon" leading a whining synth brass theme andoccasional early-80's digital orchestra hits. Both nauseating andpunishing, these sequences accompany fight scenes, conversation pieces,and travel sequences with little regard for pacing, scene change, or anyother cue identifiers.The most frustrating aspect of Powell's score forLadyhawke is the potential it shows in its more traditionalmoments. A Gregorian chant, for instance, accompanies a procession forthe evil bishop of the story, but is abandoned thereafter. The titletheme for Ladyhawke is beautifully tragic, and while it is usedwithout any effect by the rock style in the opening of the film, Powellintroduces the listener to its orchestral side with longing woodwindsand strings in "She Was Sad at First." Unfortunately, a mass error inthe string section at about 1:45 in that cue nearly ruins itslistenability. Despite representing the lost love at the heart of thefilm's mysticism, the theme is badly underutilized until the "FinalReunion," which is the orchestral highlight of the score. The triumphantstatement of this theme is very compelling in this finale, withwell-conceived brass counterpoint to the string performance. Once again,the performance is ruined by two factors: first, the end titles areimmediately mixed into the final notes of the theme, forcing theorchestra to engage with the terrible keyboard opening of the rockversion of the theme. Secondly, the string section is not powerfulenough to carry the theme over the counterpoint of the far-more engaginghorns, leaving the horns in the intriguing position of providing theirown sort of solo theme at the end. The orchestration and arrangement ofthe orchestral portions are poorly handled throughout, meaning that anycompilation performance of the otherwise outstanding title theme fromLadyhawke would have to be significantly arranged for thatpurpose. Fans of the Parsons side of things delighted in a late 1995 CDpressing that expanded the available music from the film. The originalLP releases of Ladyhawke included less than 40 minutes of music,often leaving off the more compelling, non-rock recordings. Alittle-known Italian CD release under the Genoa label in 1993 featuredidentical contents in a limited 2000-copy pressing. The 1995 GNPCrescendo album adds another half hour of score, including, mostimportantly, the full finale music. While the release is commendable,the score is still an atrocious mess, most of which is nothing less thanpainful to tolerate by today's standards of pop culture and orchestralmusic.Music as Written for Film: FRISBEEMusic as Heard on Album: *Overall: *Purchasing Options: CD Universe (New), Amazon.com (New or Used),eBay/Half.com (Used)   Viewer Ratings and Comments:Regular Average: 2.23 StarsSmart Average: 2.36 Stars******17 ****7 ***11 **24 *50 (View resultsfor all titles)    * Smart Average only includes         40% of 5-star and 1-star votes              to counterbalance fringe voting.Most Recent Comments:Read All     It's a Parsons album, that's how to deal wit...  CS_TBL  -- 11/9/06 (3:44 p.m.)   To Each His Own - I Loved This Score!  Pancho  -- 10/29/06 (10:13 a.m.)   Yeah, but one more point...  Joe Irvin  -- 10/29/06 (9:40 a.m.)Read All |Add New Post |Search |Help     Track Listings:Total Time: 63:40 1.

Most of them were completefailures, including #*#Red Sonja#*# and #*#Legend#*#, though#*#Ladyhawke#*# actually managed to become a moderate success at thebox office. Director Richard Donner as an established force, the castwas filled with young stars and old favorites, and the story wasromantically set in a familiar medieval universe. That plot looselyinvolves a curse that has caused two lovers (Michelle Pfeiffer andRutger Hauer) to take the shape of animals against their will, one atnight and one during the day, so that they can never be together. Theirencounters saving the life (and utilizing the services) of a mousyMatthew Broderick provides the action. The film has a loyal cultfollowing even two decades later, and the project is a rare example of acircumstance in which it has always been controversial because of itsmusic. Donner had worked with both John Williams and Jerry Goldsmith,though with Williams on tour and taking a break from film scoring andGoldsmith mired in the disaster of #*#Legend#*# for Ridley Scott,Donner came up with the idea of combining the services of orchestratorAndrew Powell and taking advantage of the pop culture music fad invadingfantasy films at the time. It's hard to figure exactly where the genreswitched its allegiance from the robust orchestral fantasy scores ofWilliams, James Horner, Trevor Jones, and Basil Poledouris to the morecontemporary 1980's rock scene. Some point to Toto's strangely effective#*#Dune#*# score in 1984 as the source. But in any case, 1985 fantasyfilms hastened the popular demise of the genre through this"popification." In the last gasps of the #*#Conan#*# franchise, EnnioMorricone would infuse his orchestral score with rock elements, whileGoldsmith's score for #*#Legend#*# would be tossed by the studio infavor of a Tangerine Dream replacement. And for #*#Ladyhawke#*#, Donnerand the producers reportedly heard music from the Alan Parsons Projectwhile scouting locations in Italy and decided to incorporate it as partof their film as well.#*#The end result is one of the most widely mockedsoundtracks in the history of film. The Philharmonia Orchestra in Londonis largely supplanted by music directly out of the Alan Parsons Project,with the same musical producer and engineer for this film that alsoproduced "Dark Side of the Moon" by Pink Floyd, among others.Performances here include their normal guitarist, Ian Bairnson, as well.Powell never made a career of film scoring, before or after#*#Ladyhawke#*#, and the lack of experience in integrating theorchestral and rock elements of the score are its fatal flaw. Criticsactually laughed at the score in their reviews at the time, and reviewsof the movie's DVD release have been even less kind to the score due toits very aged sound. When describing the music of Alan Parsons, somepeople refer to it as cheesy disco holdovers from the 1980's, some usethe technically correct terminology of "80's progressive rock," and mostpeople write it off as "painful 80's synth crap." For collectors oftradition film scores, #*#Ladyhawke#*# is an insufferable tragedy andunsuccessfully begs to be forgiven as a blatant mistake of its era. Evena significant portion of Alan Parsons Project collectors going back tothe LPs of the early 80's find the score distracting in the film. And itcertainly is. There's nothing as bizarre as hearing 80's progressiverock in a sword and sorcery film, and what makes the situation in#*#Ladyhawke#*# worse is that it's alternating with ten to fifteenminutes of really decent orchestral material by the London ensemble inthe film. You get bludgeoned by the 80's rock rhythms and electricguitars over cheesy keyboarding for the first half of the film, only tobe treated to some significantly rendered orchestral passages in thethird quarter, only to be slapped once again by the non-descript rock atthe end. The rock passages all sound alike, with the heartbeat effectfrom "Dark Side of the Moon" leading a whining synth brass theme andoccasional early-80's digital orchestra hits. Both nauseating andpunishing, these sequences accompany fight scenes, conversation pieces,and travel sequences with little regard for pacing, scene change, or anyother cue identifiers.#*#The most frustrating aspect of Powell's score for#*#Ladyhawke#*# is the potential it shows in its more traditionalmoments. A Gregorian chant, for instance, accompanies a procession forthe evil bishop of the story, but is abandoned thereafter. The titletheme for #*#Ladyhawke#*# is beautifully tragic, and while it is usedwithout any effect by the rock style in the opening of the film, Powellintroduces the listener to its orchestral side with longing woodwindsand strings in "She Was Sad at First." Unfortunately, a mass error inthe string section at about 1:45 in that cue nearly ruins itslistenability. Despite representing the lost love at the heart of thefilm's mysticism, the theme is badly underutilized until the "FinalReunion," which is the orchestral highlight of the score. The triumphantstatement of this theme is very compelling in this finale, withwell-conceived brass counterpoint to the string performance. Once again,the performance is ruined by two factors: first, the end titles areimmediately mixed into the final notes of the theme, forcing theorchestra to engage with the terrible keyboard opening of the rockversion of the theme. Secondly, the string section is not powerfulenough to carry the theme over the counterpoint of the far-more engaginghorns, leaving the horns in the intriguing position of providing theirown sort of solo theme at the end. The orchestration and arrangement ofthe orchestral portions are poorly handled throughout, meaning that anycompilation performance of the otherwise outstanding title theme from#*#Ladyhawke#*# would have to be significantly arranged for thatpurpose. Fans of the Parsons side of things delighted in a late 1995 CDpressing that expanded the available music from the film. The originalLP releases of #*#Ladyhawke#*# included less than 40 minutes of music,often leaving off the more compelling, non-rock recordings. Alittle-known Italian CD release under the Genoa label in 1993 featuredidentical contents in a limited 2000-copy pressing. The 1995 GNPCrescendo album adds another half hour of score, including, mostimportantly, the full finale music. While the release is commendable,the score is still an atrocious mess, most of which is nothing less thanpainful to tolerate by today's standards of pop culture and orchestralmusic.#*#Music as Written for Film: FRISBEEMusic as Heard on Album: *Overall: *#*#Purchasing Options: CD Universe#*# (New), #*#Amazon.com#*# (New or Used),#*#eBay/Half.com#*# (Used)#*#   Viewer Ratings and Comments:Regular Average: 2.23 StarsSmart Average: 2.36 Stars******17 ****7 ***11 **24 *50 (View resultsfor all titles)    * Smart Average only includes         40% of 5-star and 1-star votes              to counterbalance fringe voting.Most Recent Comments:Read All     It's a Parsons album, that's how to deal wit...  CS_TBL  -- 11/9/06 (3:44 p.m.)   To Each His Own - I Loved This Score!  Pancho  -- 10/29/06 (10:13 a.m.)   Yeah, but one more point...  Joe Irvin  -- 10/29/06 (9:40 a.m.)Read All |Add New Post |Search |Help     Track Listings:Total Time: 63:40 1.

"Quantum physics has provided an important platform for such a belief in recent years. There are many in my profession who now believe that medical science is the pursuit of helping the patient from the bottom up while a belief or faith in a higher consciousness is helping the patient from the top down."Dr Powell, who was brought up in the Christian tradition', and has published medical papers in which he admits experimenting with LSD and mescaline with his professor's approval while studying medicine and psychiatry, was careful to make a distinction between religion and spirituality when describing what he meant by a faith in a higher power."I see the world's religions as rivers, all flowing into the same sea," he said.During a question-and-answer session, which followed Dr Powell's talk, a member of the audience drew a round of applause when he described how he had witnessed what the doctor had described, first hand, after attending addicts' meetingsHe said: "People who have repeatedly failed to stop drinking or taking drugs for many years, miraculously stop when they find a higher power through Alcoholics and Narcotics Anonymous."7:29pm Wednesday 27th October 2004Print   SendPost this story to: Digg | del.icio.us | Furl | reddit | NowPublic | Yahoo!

He is Chair of the Spirituality and Psychiatry Special Interest Group, Royal College of Psychiatrists (correspondence: c/o Sue Duncan, Royal College of Psychiatrists, 17 Belgrave Square, London SW1X 8PG; e-mail: AndrewSPowell{at}compuserve.com).British psychiatry has largely focused on the biology of mental disorder, supported over recent years by advances in the neurosciences. There has been a somewhat awkward fit with psychology, since psychology is based on the concept of mind, and how the mind and brain are related is far from clear. The view taken by many is to regard mind as epiphenomenal, on the basis that the brain itself is somehow generating consciousness. In this model of the psyche, there is no need to postulate a soul. We are nothing but the product of our genes, as Richard Dawkins (1976) would have us believe. Such an assertion comes at the tail end of an epoch that began 300 years ago with the intellectual giants, René Descartes and Isaac Newton. Descartes set down a lasting blueprint for science, that he would hold nothing to be true unless he could prove to his satisfaction that it was true. Newton laid the foundation of a mechanical universe, in which time is absolute and space is structured according to the laws of motion, a cosmos of stars and planets all held in place by the forces of momentum and gravitation. Both Descartes and Newton were deeply religious men. Descartes' famous saying, "Cogito ergo sum", led him simply to argue that God had created two classes of substance, a mental world and a physical world, while Newton spent more time engrossed in his alchemical researches than working out the laws of motion. Yet their discoveries led to an enduring split between religion and science with which we live to this day. The Church could no longer claim to understand how the universe worked, for its mediaeval cosmology had been swept aside. As the mental and physical worlds drifted further apart, God became a shadowy figure behind the scenes, whose only function was winding up the mainspring of the universe. In the past 100 years, the science of psychology has redefined the mental world along essentially humanist lines, a mind-set that can be traced back to Sigmund Freud (1927), who saw religion as a massive defence against neurosis. Even Carl Jung was careful to stay within the bounds of psychology when defining the soul as "the living thing in Man, that which lives of itself and causes life" (1959: p. 26). Our patients have no such reservations. We know from a survey carried out by the Mental Health Foundation (Faulkner, 1997) that over 50% of service users hold religious or spiritual beliefs that they see as important in helping them cope with mental illness, yet do not feel free, as they would wish, to discuss these beliefs with the psychiatrist. Need there be such a divide between psychiatrists and their patients? If we care to look at some of the advances in physics over the past 75 years, we find good cause to think again. In the light of quantum mechanics, Newton's view of a physical world that is substantial, fixed and independent of mind is no longer tenable. For example, the famous waveparticle experiment shows that when a beam of light is shone through a narrow slit so that it falls on a particle detector, subatomic packets of light called quanta strike the detector screen like miniature bullets. Change the apparatus to two slits side by side and the light coming through the slits generates a wave interference pattern, just as ripples criss-cross when two stones are dropped side by side into a pond. Particles become waves and waves become particles. Both of these dimensional realities have equal validity and cannot be divorced from the consciousness of the participantobserver. This is but a window onto a greater vista, for current superstring theory postulates many more dimensions than our local spacetime can accommodate. No longer is the electron thought of as a particle that spins around the atom like a miniature solar system. Instead, it is conceptualised as virtual, being smeared throughout all space in a quantum wave that only collapses as a particle into our physical spacetime when the consciousness of the observer is engaged in the act of measurement. Nor can its velocity and position ever both be known at the same time, for when the quantum wave collapses, there is only a statistical probability that the electron will turn up where it is expected. It may just materialise hundreds, thousands or even millions of miles away. When it does so, it arrives at that place instantaneously, transcending the limits of both space and time. Here is what three eminent physicists have to say. "The fundamental process of nature lies outside spacetime but generates events that can be located in spacetime." (Stapp, 1977: p. 202) "Ultimately, the entire universe (with all its particles, including those constituting human beings, their laboratories, observing instruments, etc.) has to be understood as a single undivided whole, in which analysis into separately and independently existent parts has no fundamental status." (Bohm, 1983: p. 174) "The universe exists as formless potentia in myriad possible branches in the transcendent domain and becomes manifest only when observed by conscious beings." (Goswami, 1993: p. 141) When consciousness collapses the wave function into the spacetime of our perceptual world, mind and matter arise simultaneously, like two sides of one coin. The brain, of course, is crucial in this; mind, the capacity for individual self-awareness, is constellated with each physical self. Consciousness is then perpetuated through repeated further collapse of the wave function. (The process can be compared with the individual frames of a film flowing together to create movement.) In this way, we are continually generating what we think of as reality, characterised by memories, our personal histories and an enduring sense of identity. (Fortunately for us, our shared world of sense perception has structural stability, not because it is independent of consciousness but because the probability wave from which it arises has been collectively generated by all conscious beings throughout time.) Quantum effects show up most readily at the subatomic level, but empirical research into large-scale systems has also demonstrated that mind can influence matter. For example, random number generators have been shown, over thousands of trials, to yield scores correlating with the mental intention of the experimenter (Schmidt, 1987). More striking still are those unaccountable events we call miracles. Since the wave function contains, in potentia, all that ever was, is and shall be, there is no limit in principle to what is possible. Why should not a mind of such exceptional power as that of Jesus collapse the wave uniquely and thereby turn water into wine? Evidence for the non-locality of consciousness was first demonstrated over 25 years ago, when it was shown that experimental subjects who are emotionally attuned can synchronise their brain waves at a distance from each other (Targ & Puthoff, 1974). Remote viewing and precognition have since been firmly established on an empirical basis (Radin, 1997). The efficacy of prayer has been researched (Byrd, 1988), as have more than 150 controlled studies on healing (Benor, 1992). Such findings merit the epithet paranormal only if we view them through Newtonian glasses. Who can therefore say what does not exist in the quantum domain, from the supreme consciousness we call God, to those sensed presences (often of the newly departed) that psychiatrists refer to as pseudo-hallucinations, down to unruly spirits that, according to the traditions of many societies, blight the lives of those they persecute? When we enquire into the beliefs our patients hold, such matters deserve to be discussed with a genuinely open mind. We do not have the answers and indeed our patients may sometimes be closer to the truth than we know. Nor are we required to affirm a particular religious or spiritual viewpoint but simply to treat the often strange experiences told us by our patients as authentic. This can sometimes be uncomfortable, for we are trained to judge with confidence the difference between fantasy and reality and to diagnose accordingly. Yet it comes a whole lot easier once we concede the limitations of spacetime, which we can do by taking an unprejudiced intellectual position or experientially through spiritual practice. People in sound mental health, who sense that beyond the doors of perception lies a greater world, can use such awareness to enrich their lives, be it through prayer, mediumship or mystical reverie. But where there is mental turmoil, whatever its cause, that same sensitivity brings profound distress (Powell, 1988, 2000). Then the psychiatrist who takes into account biological, psychological and spiritual aspects alike is well placed to help. The stigma that so often burdens our patients is not only the result of social opprobrium. It is fuelled by the experience of estrangement from humankind, one that we as psychiatrists can surely help to overcome. ReferencesBenor, D.

Most of them were completefailures, including Red Sonja and Legend, thoughLadyhawke actually managed to become a moderate success at thebox office. Director Richard Donner as an established force, the castwas filled with young stars and old favorites, and the story wasromantically set in a familiar medieval universe. That plot looselyinvolves a curse that has caused two lovers (Michelle Pfeiffer andRutger Hauer) to take the shape of animals against their will, one atnight and one during the day, so that they can never be together. Theirencounters saving the life (and utilizing the services) of a mousyMatthew Broderick provides the action. The film has a loyal cultfollowing even two decades later, and the project is a rare example of acircumstance in which it has always been controversial because of itsmusic. Donner had worked with both John Williams and Jerry Goldsmith,though with Williams on tour and taking a break from film scoring andGoldsmith mired in the disaster of Legend for Ridley Scott,Donner came up with the idea of combining the services of orchestratorAndrew Powell and taking advantage of the pop culture music fad invadingfantasy films at the time. It's hard to figure exactly where the genreswitched its allegiance from the robust orchestral fantasy scores ofWilliams, James Horner, Trevor Jones, and Basil Poledouris to the morecontemporary 1980's rock scene. Some point to Toto's strangely effectiveDune score in 1984 as the source. But in any case, 1985 fantasyfilms hastened the popular demise of the genre through this"popification." In the last gasps of the Conan franchise, EnnioMorricone would infuse his orchestral score with rock elements, whileGoldsmith's score for Legend would be tossed by the studio infavor of a Tangerine Dream replacement. And for Ladyhawke, Donnerand the producers reportedly heard music from the Alan Parsons Projectwhile scouting locations in Italy and decided to incorporate it as partof their film as well.The end result is one of the most widely mockedsoundtracks in the history of film. The Philharmonia Orchestra in Londonis largely supplanted by music directly out of the Alan Parsons Project,with the same musical producer and engineer for this film that alsoproduced "Dark Side of the Moon" by Pink Floyd, among others.Performances here include their normal guitarist, Ian Bairnson, as well.Powell never made a career of film scoring, before or afterLadyhawke, and the lack of experience in integrating theorchestral and rock elements of the score are its fatal flaw. Criticsactually laughed at the score in their reviews at the time, and reviewsof the movie's DVD release have been even less kind to the score due toits very aged sound. When describing the music of Alan Parsons, somepeople refer to it as cheesy disco holdovers from the 1980's, some usethe technically correct terminology of "80's progressive rock," and mostpeople write it off as "painful 80's synth crap." For collectors oftradition film scores, Ladyhawke is an insufferable tragedy andunsuccessfully begs to be forgiven as a blatant mistake of its era. Evena significant portion of Alan Parsons Project collectors going back tothe LPs of the early 80's find the score distracting in the film. And itcertainly is. There's nothing as bizarre as hearing 80's progressiverock in a sword and sorcery film, and what makes the situation inLadyhawke worse is that it's alternating with ten to fifteenminutes of really decent orchestral material by the London ensemble inthe film. You get bludgeoned by the 80's rock rhythms and electricguitars over cheesy keyboarding for the first half of the film, only tobe treated to some significantly rendered orchestral passages in thethird quarter, only to be slapped once again by the non-descript rock atthe end. The rock passages all sound alike, with the heartbeat effectfrom "Dark Side of the Moon" leading a whining synth brass theme andoccasional early-80's digital orchestra hits. Both nauseating andpunishing, these sequences accompany fight scenes, conversation pieces,and travel sequences with little regard for pacing, scene change, or anyother cue identifiers.The most frustrating aspect of Powell's score forLadyhawke is the potential it shows in its more traditionalmoments. A Gregorian chant, for instance, accompanies a procession forthe evil bishop of the story, but is abandoned thereafter. The titletheme for Ladyhawke is beautifully tragic, and while it is usedwithout any effect by the rock style in the opening of the film, Powellintroduces the listener to its orchestral side with longing woodwindsand strings in "She Was Sad at First." Unfortunately, a mass error inthe string section at about 1:45 in that cue nearly ruins itslistenability. Despite representing the lost love at the heart of thefilm's mysticism, the theme is badly underutilized until the "FinalReunion," which is the orchestral highlight of the score. The triumphantstatement of this theme is very compelling in this finale, withwell-conceived brass counterpoint to the string performance. Once again,the performance is ruined by two factors: first, the end titles areimmediately mixed into the final notes of the theme, forcing theorchestra to engage with the terrible keyboard opening of the rockversion of the theme. Secondly, the string section is not powerfulenough to carry the theme over the counterpoint of the far-more engaginghorns, leaving the horns in the intriguing position of providing theirown sort of solo theme at the end. The orchestration and arrangement ofthe orchestral portions are poorly handled throughout, meaning that anycompilation performance of the otherwise outstanding title theme fromLadyhawke would have to be significantly arranged for thatpurpose. Fans of the Parsons side of things delighted in a late 1995 CDpressing that expanded the available music from the film. The originalLP releases of Ladyhawke included less than 40 minutes of music,often leaving off the more compelling, non-rock recordings. Alittle-known Italian CD release under the Genoa label in 1993 featuredidentical contents in a limited 2000-copy pressing. The 1995 GNPCrescendo album adds another half hour of score, including, mostimportantly, the full finale music. While the release is commendable,the score is still an atrocious mess, most of which is nothing less thanpainful to tolerate by today's standards of pop culture and orchestralmusic.Music as Written for Film: FRISBEEMusic as Heard on Album: *Overall: *Purchasing Options: CD Universe (New), Amazon.com (New or Used),eBay/Half.com (Used)   Viewer Ratings and Comments:Regular Average: 2.23 StarsSmart Average: 2.36 Stars******17 ****7 ***11 **24 *50 (View resultsfor all titles)    * Smart Average only includes         40% of 5-star and 1-star votes              to counterbalance fringe voting.Most Recent Comments:Read All     It's a Parsons album, that's how to deal wit...  CS_TBL  -- 11/9/06 (3:44 p.m.)   To Each His Own - I Loved This Score!  Pancho  -- 10/29/06 (10:13 a.m.)   Yeah, but one more point...  Joe Irvin  -- 10/29/06 (9:40 a.m.)Read All |Add New Post |Search |Help     Track Listings:Total Time: 63:40 1.

He is Chair of the Spirituality and Psychiatry Special Interest Group, Royal College of Psychiatrists (correspondence: c/o Sue Duncan, Royal College of Psychiatrists, 17 Belgrave Square, London SW1X 8PG; e-mail: AndrewSPowell{at}compuserve.com).British psychiatry has largely focused on the biology of mental disorder, supported over recent years by advances in the neurosciences. There has been a somewhat awkward fit with psychology, since psychology is based on the concept of mind, and how the mind and brain are related is far from clear. The view taken by many is to regard mind as epiphenomenal, on the basis that the brain itself is somehow generating consciousness. In this model of the psyche, there is no need to postulate a soul. We are nothing but the product of our genes, as Richard Dawkins (1976) would have us believe. Such an assertion comes at the tail end of an epoch that began 300 years ago with the intellectual giants, René Descartes and Isaac Newton. Descartes set down a lasting blueprint for science, that he would hold nothing to be true unless he could prove to his satisfaction that it was true. Newton laid the foundation of a mechanical universe, in which time is absolute and space is structured according to the laws of motion, a cosmos of stars and planets all held in place by the forces of momentum and gravitation. Both Descartes and Newton were deeply religious men. Descartes' famous saying, "Cogito ergo sum", led him simply to argue that God had created two classes of substance, a mental world and a physical world, while Newton spent more time engrossed in his alchemical researches than working out the laws of motion. Yet their discoveries led to an enduring split between religion and science with which we live to this day. The Church could no longer claim to understand how the universe worked, for its mediaeval cosmology had been swept aside. As the mental and physical worlds drifted further apart, God became a shadowy figure behind the scenes, whose only function was winding up the mainspring of the universe. In the past 100 years, the science of psychology has redefined the mental world along essentially humanist lines, a mind-set that can be traced back to Sigmund Freud (1927), who saw religion as a massive defence against neurosis. Even Carl Jung was careful to stay within the bounds of psychology when defining the soul as "the living thing in Man, that which lives of itself and causes life" (1959: p. 26). Our patients have no such reservations. We know from a survey carried out by the Mental Health Foundation (Faulkner, 1997) that over 50% of service users hold religious or spiritual beliefs that they see as important in helping them cope with mental illness, yet do not feel free, as they would wish, to discuss these beliefs with the psychiatrist. Need there be such a divide between psychiatrists and their patients? If we care to look at some of the advances in physics over the past 75 years, we find good cause to think again. In the light of quantum mechanics, Newton's view of a physical world that is substantial, fixed and independent of mind is no longer tenable. For example, the famous waveparticle experiment shows that when a beam of light is shone through a narrow slit so that it falls on a particle detector, subatomic packets of light called quanta strike the detector screen like miniature bullets. Change the apparatus to two slits side by side and the light coming through the slits generates a wave interference pattern, just as ripples criss-cross when two stones are dropped side by side into a pond. Particles become waves and waves become particles. Both of these dimensional realities have equal validity and cannot be divorced from the consciousness of the participantobserver. This is but a window onto a greater vista, for current superstring theory postulates many more dimensions than our local spacetime can accommodate. No longer is the electron thought of as a particle that spins around the atom like a miniature solar system. Instead, it is conceptualised as virtual, being smeared throughout all space in a quantum wave that only collapses as a particle into our physical spacetime when the consciousness of the observer is engaged in the act of measurement. Nor can its velocity and position ever both be known at the same time, for when the quantum wave collapses, there is only a statistical probability that the electron will turn up where it is expected. It may just materialise hundreds, thousands or even millions of miles away. When it does so, it arrives at that place instantaneously, transcending the limits of both space and time. Here is what three eminent physicists have to say. "The fundamental process of nature lies outside spacetime but generates events that can be located in spacetime." (Stapp, 1977: p. 202) "Ultimately, the entire universe (with all its particles, including those constituting human beings, their laboratories, observing instruments, etc.) has to be understood as a single undivided whole, in which analysis into separately and independently existent parts has no fundamental status." (Bohm, 1983: p. 174) "The universe exists as formless potentia in myriad possible branches in the transcendent domain and becomes manifest only when observed by conscious beings." (Goswami, 1993: p. 141) When consciousness collapses the wave function into the spacetime of our perceptual world, mind and matter arise simultaneously, like two sides of one coin. The brain, of course, is crucial in this; mind, the capacity for individual self-awareness, is constellated with each physical self. Consciousness is then perpetuated through repeated further collapse of the wave function. (The process can be compared with the individual frames of a film flowing together to create movement.) In this way, we are continually generating what we think of as reality, characterised by memories, our personal histories and an enduring sense of identity. (Fortunately for us, our shared world of sense perception has structural stability, not because it is independent of consciousness but because the probability wave from which it arises has been collectively generated by all conscious beings throughout time.) Quantum effects show up most readily at the subatomic level, but empirical research into large-scale systems has also demonstrated that mind can influence matter. For example, random number generators have been shown, over thousands of trials, to yield scores correlating with the mental intention of the experimenter (Schmidt, 1987). More striking still are those unaccountable events we call miracles. Since the wave function contains, in potentia, all that ever was, is and shall be, there is no limit in principle to what is possible. Why should not a mind of such exceptional power as that of Jesus collapse the wave uniquely and thereby turn water into wine? Evidence for the non-locality of consciousness was first demonstrated over 25 years ago, when it was shown that experimental subjects who are emotionally attuned can synchronise their brain waves at a distance from each other (Targ & Puthoff, 1974). Remote viewing and precognition have since been firmly established on an empirical basis (Radin, 1997). The efficacy of prayer has been researched (Byrd, 1988), as have more than 150 controlled studies on healing (Benor, 1992). Such findings merit the epithet paranormal only if we view them through Newtonian glasses. Who can therefore say what does not exist in the quantum domain, from the supreme consciousness we call God, to those sensed presences (often of the newly departed) that psychiatrists refer to as pseudo-hallucinations, down to unruly spirits that, according to the traditions of many societies, blight the lives of those they persecute? When we enquire into the beliefs our patients hold, such matters deserve to be discussed with a genuinely open mind. We do not have the answers and indeed our patients may sometimes be closer to the truth than we know. Nor are we required to affirm a particular religious or spiritual viewpoint but simply to treat the often strange experiences told us by our patients as authentic. This can sometimes be uncomfortable, for we are trained to judge with confidence the difference between fantasy and reality and to diagnose accordingly. Yet it comes a whole lot easier once we concede the limitations of spacetime, which we can do by taking an unprejudiced intellectual position or experientially through spiritual practice. People in sound mental health, who sense that beyond the doors of perception lies a greater world, can use such awareness to enrich their lives, be it through prayer, mediumship or mystical reverie. But where there is mental turmoil, whatever its cause, that same sensitivity brings profound distress (Powell, 1988, 2000). Then the psychiatrist who takes into account biological, psychological and spiritual aspects alike is well placed to help. The stigma that so often burdens our patients is not only the result of social opprobrium. It is fuelled by the experience of estrangement from humankind, one that we as psychiatrists can surely help to overcome. ReferencesBenor, D.

He is Chair of the Spirituality and Psychiatry Special Interest Group, Royal College of Psychiatrists (correspondence: c/o Sue Duncan, Royal College of Psychiatrists, 17 Belgrave Square, London SW1X 8PG; e-mail: AndrewSPowell{at}compuserve.com).British psychiatry has largely focused on the biology of mental disorder, supported over recent years by advances in the neurosciences. There has been a somewhat awkward fit with psychology, since psychology is based on the concept of mind, and how the mind and brain are related is far from clear. The view taken by many is to regard mind as epiphenomenal, on the basis that the brain itself is somehow generating consciousness. In this model of the psyche, there is no need to postulate a soul. We are nothing but the product of our genes, as Richard Dawkins (1976) would have us believe. Such an assertion comes at the tail end of an epoch that began 300 years ago with the intellectual giants, René Descartes and Isaac Newton. Descartes set down a lasting blueprint for science, that he would hold nothing to be true unless he could prove to his satisfaction that it was true. Newton laid the foundation of a mechanical universe, in which time is absolute and space is structured according to the laws of motion, a cosmos of stars and planets all held in place by the forces of momentum and gravitation. Both Descartes and Newton were deeply religious men. Descartes' famous saying, "Cogito ergo sum", led him simply to argue that God had created two classes of substance, a mental world and a physical world, while Newton spent more time engrossed in his alchemical researches than working out the laws of motion. Yet their discoveries led to an enduring split between religion and science with which we live to this day. The Church could no longer claim to understand how the universe worked, for its mediaeval cosmology had been swept aside. As the mental and physical worlds drifted further apart, God became a shadowy figure behind the scenes, whose only function was winding up the mainspring of the universe. In the past 100 years, the science of psychology has redefined the mental world along essentially humanist lines, a mind-set that can be traced back to Sigmund Freud (1927), who saw religion as a massive defence against neurosis. Even Carl Jung was careful to stay within the bounds of psychology when defining the soul as "the living thing in Man, that which lives of itself and causes life" (1959: p. 26). Our patients have no such reservations. We know from a survey carried out by the Mental Health Foundation (Faulkner, 1997) that over 50% of service users hold religious or spiritual beliefs that they see as important in helping them cope with mental illness, yet do not feel free, as they would wish, to discuss these beliefs with the psychiatrist. Need there be such a divide between psychiatrists and their patients? If we care to look at some of the advances in physics over the past 75 years, we find good cause to think again. In the light of quantum mechanics, Newton's view of a physical world that is substantial, fixed and independent of mind is no longer tenable. For example, the famous waveparticle experiment shows that when a beam of light is shone through a narrow slit so that it falls on a particle detector, subatomic packets of light called quanta strike the detector screen like miniature bullets. Change the apparatus to two slits side by side and the light coming through the slits generates a wave interference pattern, just as ripples criss-cross when two stones are dropped side by side into a pond. Particles become waves and waves become particles. Both of these dimensional realities have equal validity and cannot be divorced from the consciousness of the participantobserver. This is but a window onto a greater vista, for current superstring theory postulates many more dimensions than our local spacetime can accommodate. No longer is the electron thought of as a particle that spins around the atom like a miniature solar system. Instead, it is conceptualised as virtual, being smeared throughout all space in a quantum wave that only collapses as a particle into our physical spacetime when the consciousness of the observer is engaged in the act of measurement. Nor can its velocity and position ever both be known at the same time, for when the quantum wave collapses, there is only a statistical probability that the electron will turn up where it is expected. It may just materialise hundreds, thousands or even millions of miles away. When it does so, it arrives at that place instantaneously, transcending the limits of both space and time. Here is what three eminent physicists have to say. "The fundamental process of nature lies outside spacetime but generates events that can be located in spacetime." (Stapp, 1977: p. 202) "Ultimately, the entire universe (with all its particles, including those constituting human beings, their laboratories, observing instruments, etc.) has to be understood as a single undivided whole, in which analysis into separately and independently existent parts has no fundamental status." (Bohm, 1983: p. 174) "The universe exists as formless potentia in myriad possible branches in the transcendent domain and becomes manifest only when observed by conscious beings." (Goswami, 1993: p. 141) When consciousness collapses the wave function into the spacetime of our perceptual world, mind and matter arise simultaneously, like two sides of one coin. The brain, of course, is crucial in this; mind, the capacity for individual self-awareness, is constellated with each physical self. Consciousness is then perpetuated through repeated further collapse of the wave function. (The process can be compared with the individual frames of a film flowing together to create movement.) In this way, we are continually generating what we think of as reality, characterised by memories, our personal histories and an enduring sense of identity. (Fortunately for us, our shared world of sense perception has structural stability, not because it is independent of consciousness but because the probability wave from which it arises has been collectively generated by all conscious beings throughout time.) Quantum effects show up most readily at the subatomic level, but empirical research into large-scale systems has also demonstrated that mind can influence matter. For example, random number generators have been shown, over thousands of trials, to yield scores correlating with the mental intention of the experimenter (Schmidt, 1987). More striking still are those unaccountable events we call miracles. Since the wave function contains, in potentia, all that ever was, is and shall be, there is no limit in principle to what is possible. Why should not a mind of such exceptional power as that of Jesus collapse the wave uniquely and thereby turn water into wine? Evidence for the non-locality of consciousness was first demonstrated over 25 years ago, when it was shown that experimental subjects who are emotionally attuned can synchronise their brain waves at a distance from each other (Targ & Puthoff, 1974). Remote viewing and precognition have since been firmly established on an empirical basis (Radin, 1997). The efficacy of prayer has been researched (Byrd, 1988), as have more than 150 controlled studies on healing (Benor, 1992). Such findings merit the epithet paranormal only if we view them through Newtonian glasses. Who can therefore say what does not exist in the quantum domain, from the supreme consciousness we call God, to those sensed presences (often of the newly departed) that psychiatrists refer to as pseudo-hallucinations, down to unruly spirits that, according to the traditions of many societies, blight the lives of those they persecute? When we enquire into the beliefs our patients hold, such matters deserve to be discussed with a genuinely open mind. We do not have the answers and indeed our patients may sometimes be closer to the truth than we know. Nor are we required to affirm a particular religious or spiritual viewpoint but simply to treat the often strange experiences told us by our patients as authentic. This can sometimes be uncomfortable, for we are trained to judge with confidence the difference between fantasy and reality and to diagnose accordingly. Yet it comes a whole lot easier once we concede the limitations of spacetime, which we can do by taking an unprejudiced intellectual position or experientially through spiritual practice. People in sound mental health, who sense that beyond the doors of perception lies a greater world, can use such awareness to enrich their lives, be it through prayer, mediumship or mystical reverie. But where there is mental turmoil, whatever its cause, that same sensitivity brings profound distress (Powell, 1988, 2000). Then the psychiatrist who takes into account biological, psychological and spiritual aspects alike is well placed to help. The stigma that so often burdens our patients is not only the result of social opprobrium. It is fuelled by the experience of estrangement from humankind, one that we as psychiatrists can surely help to overcome. ReferencesBenor, D.

Andrew Powell - Memory Alpha - A Wikia wikiAndrew PowellFrom Memory Alpha, the free Star Trek reference. Andrew Powell.Lieutenant Andrew Powell was a Human Starfleet science officer serving aboard the USS Enterprise-D.He began dating Nurse Alyssa Ogawa in 2370, and their relationship became serious.  Powell joined Ogawa's friends, including Sam Lavelle, in a poker game on at least one occassion.  Sam later said, jokingly, that Powell was probably the worst poker player he had ever seen.  However, Ogawa worried that they were drifting apart after Powell cancelled a date and began putting in overtime on a research proposal.  Dr. Beverly Crusher also saw Powell talking with another woman in Ten Forward.  When Crusher asked Ogawa about the status of their romance out of concern, Ogawa revealed that Powell had proposed to her and that they planned to announce the engagement after the midyear crew evaluations.  (TNG: "Lower Decks")Ogawa became pregnant with their first child soon following their engagement.  Powell was initially shocked, and Lieutenant Commander Data offered to share his insights on parenthood, gained from experiences with Spot. (TNG: "Genesis")A man who was presumably Powell was seen with Alyssa after she lost the baby due to the effects of the temporal anomaly in the anti-time present in TNG: "All Good Things..."  He did not speak and the actor who played him, extra Brian Demonbreun, was not credited for the role.Retrieved from "http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Andrew_Powell"Categories: Humans | Starfleet personnel | USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D) personnel Beta Test A new Search EngineTry out our new search engine and help us make it better.

Interactivity in Special Libraries - Editorial: Coleman and Oxnam: JoDIJournal of Digital Information, Volume 2 Issue 4Article No. 132, 2002-05-31To cite this paper please include the details above in the full referenceThemes: Digital librariesPrintable version available.Interactional Digital Libraries: introduction to a special issue on Interactivityin Digital LibrariesAnita Coleman and Maliaca Oxnam*Special issue editors, School of Information Resources & LibraryScience, University of Arizona,Tucson, AZ, USAEmail: asc@u.arizona.edu*Science-Engineering LibraryEmail: oxnamm@u.library.arizona.eduAdvances in Internet technologies have made it seemingly possible andeasy to create digital collections, repositories and libraries. However,supporting diverse information uses that facilitate interaction beyondsearching and browsing is in the early stages. Interactive digital libraries,or interactional digital libraries as we prefer to call them, are stillevolving. This special issue tries to bring together work that is beingdone to incorporate interactivity in digital libraries.The issue evolved in cooperation with some of the successful recipientsof the 2002 National Science Digital Library (NSDL) program solicitationsponsored by the National Science Foundation (NSF). In fall 2001, a fewmonths after the NSDL awards were announced, we browsed through the listof currently active awards and read 64 abstracts. We selected 13 NSF-NSDLprojects that highlighted interactivity as a key feature of their researchand development efforts. We sent the principal investigators an invitationto write for this special issue and also posted a public callfor papers. Experts from Europe and the US, with academic and practiceaffiliations, many of whom refereed two papers apiece, provided invaluablefeedback. After peer review and revisions we are pleased to share nineof these papers (six NSDL-related and three others).The NSDL program "aims to establish a national digital library thatwill constitute an online network of learning environments and resourcesfor science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) educationat all levels" (NSF-NSDL2002). Reportsand background material on the NSF-NSDL program are available fromthe NSF Web site.As noted, not all papers in this issue are from the NSDL initiative.Nevertheless, the common subthemes for all papers are the technologies,information uses and theories driving content developmentfor interactional digital libraries. The NSDL papers have an additionalcomponent in that they address the process of interactivity in the contextof formal undergraduate learning. They make clear that interactivity ismore than just a point and click approach to learning. Interactivty canstimulate, through reciprocal action, feedback, immersion, play, flow andother designed attributes, user acquisition of abstract concepts and skillsbesides discipline-based, content learnng outcomes. Further, the reportsof interfaces, services, tools and collections provide a view of informationuse behaviors in disciplines such as astronomy, earth sciences and mathematics.Some of the focus is on actual information use: what do the technologiesenable the user to do with documents once they've found the information?We hope that bringing these papers together in a special issue is useful.Additionally, we would like to issue a challenge to JoDI readers,authors and researchers in the realm of interactional digital libraries.The ChallengeInteractional digital libraries can and should draw from research in severalareas such as Human Computer Interaction (HCI), Information Retrieval,Educational Technology, and Instructional Design. In tracing the historyof HCI development, Dillon (2002, p. 463) notes that “HCI has always soughtto be more than just about user interface design but about interaction”.He outlines three stages of HCI development. In the first stage, the focuswas on interface design with a strong methodological tradition that believedin user testing as the best means of improving user-interface design (Shackel1959, Schneiderman 1980). In the second stage, attempts were made to modelinteraction. Modeling interaction was grounded in a theoretical traditionthat tried to develop an all-embracing theory of interaction (generalizedlaws and principles of interaction) based on specific interactive phenomena.Interactive phenomena such as differences in reading speed for digitaland paper media (Gould et al. 1987), expert performance speeds forroutine cognitive tasks (Card et al. 1983), and user performancein menu-based navigation tasks (Norman 1992) were studied. The theoriesdeveloped, however, still do not have sufficient predictive power aboutuser issues that are important to usable systems design. On the positiveside, user testing is no longer the only way to design usable systems.The third stage in HCI, still unattained, is to support the design of morehumanly acceptable information technologies that will enhance and augmenthuman capabilities in all spheres.The problematic situation facing digital library design and use canbe stated as a set of basic research questions: What is an interactionaldigital library? How will people use interactional digital libraries? Howcan interactional digital libraries enhance and augment human capabilities?These questions can also be reframed as three challenges for further digitallibrary development:1. Information Spaces. McKnight (2000, p. 730) uses informationspace to mean "objects (real or virtual) to which the individual turnsto acquire information”. Information spaces will increasingly be made upof heterogeneous formats. Dillon (2002) calls this the multimedia mix-and-match.The challenge is the “smooth blending of multimedia” in interfaces (ibid.,p. 469). How can information displays in digital libraries enable usersto extract meanings by mixing multimedia (sound, graphics, video, text,all seamlessly linked) for an interactive experience? Furthermore, newtechnologies will result in “wholly new forms”, possibly new genres ofinformation that will only exist digitally; genres may also be consciouslydesigned. In fact Winograd (1996) argues for this. Tools are needed tosupport the transformation and derivations of new genres from underlyinginformation units by readers of documents and the users of digital libaries.The first challenge is to build information spaces that are heterogeneousand include support tools for shaping them.2. Learning Spaces. Coleman et al. (2001) define learningspaces in digital libraries as information spaces that are based on knowledgeorganization and instructional design principles. Learning spaces displaythe best information for learning in an optimal manner; they incorporateintelligent, interactive information retrieval, customized for or controlledby users' learning styles. They use instructional technology, which isconcerned with information layout and sequencing for user understandingand improvement of learning. They offer the promise of improving the learningof difficult, abstract concepts and skills such as scientific reasoningby incorporating the notion of information work (Sundaram 1996a, 1996b).Taxonomies of tasks and user behaviors in the context of disciplinary andgeneral learning are developed; scientific classifications and generalknowledge representation schemes are merged with tasks and learning outcomesto develop ontologies and information-use maps. The second challenge isto build learning spaces that go beyond the ability to retrieve information,and include the facility to customize and filter information, to get onlyrelevant documents, to adjust sequencing and presentation of informationaccording to learning theories, information-seeking and disciplinary usebehaviors. Thus, knowledge representation techniques that facilitate informationuse for learning tasks, information visualizations that transcend humanprocessing limitations, and user evaluation that is woven into design,play key roles in building learning spaces.3. Interaction Spaces. Winograd (2002, p. 260) questions thecurrent model of interaction architecture and device communication - basedon the standard figure of a user in front of a screen with a keyboard/pointingdevice - and argues for the need to evolve towards a different architectureof multiple users in interactive spaces. Dillon (2002) refers to this as'Ubiquity' or ‘We Want Information Where We Are'. Ubiquitous computersmay help reduce the problem of information overload (Weiser 2001). Informationaccess is a question of whether users get information from a device, whetherold devices may be modified to provide new functions, or whether we meetthe real challenge of freeing human users from the multiplicity of physicallylocated devices for information access. Therefore, the third challengeis to build such interaction spaces for digital libraries that both freethe user from physical limitations as well as provide the benefits of virtualinteractions (for example, asynchronous interactivity) and communitiesto digital libraries.The information-learning-interaction spaces challenge provides a frameworkand directs digital library research and development to the human ratherthan just the technical problems. It is also grounded in the realizationthat libraries, whether they are digital or traditional, are socially constructed,and that the values of a society are embodied in the use of a library.Are these challenges realistic? Are such interactional digital librariespossible? Can they be built for successful use? We invite the communityto discuss and explore. The papers in this issue show how current projectsand initiatives are handling some of the challenges.Hoban et al. in Virtual Telescopesin Education, present the philosophical and resulting technical approachesto the role of interactivity in digital libraries. They use interactivityto enable the participation of novices in the scientific process just asexpert astronomers do on a daily basis. Designing a customizable virtualobservatory is only one element in engaging learners in this process-drivenenvironment. To encourage them to participate in the scientific inquiryprocess, learners are guided through developing a research proposal, gatheringand analyzing data, drawing conclusions and developing a report on theirfindings.In Thematic Real-time EnvironmentalDistributed Data Services (THREDDS), Domenicoet al. discussthe characteristics of earth systems data and illustrate specialized visualizationand analysis tools being developed to allow the user to manipulate andinteract with earth systems data. A related paper,Atmospheric Visualization Collection: Developmentsin the NSDL by Klaus et al.,highlights the differences between public users and researchers in usingtheir visualization database of atmospheric data. It illustrates how incorporatinginteractive assessment and development activities into the learning environmentsencourages participation and establishes an interactive user-provider community.Clark et al. in DigitalArchive Network for Anthropology highlight the opportunity forinteractive digital collections in anthropology and discuss work beingdone to create an interactive virtual laboratory experience for people from all levels who haveinterests in anthropology. Capabilities for creating both two- and three-dimensionalmodels of materials that can be manipulated, allowing the user to takeprecise measurements, all enhance the experience and detailed study ofanthropological specimens. Further, they increase research accessibilityas some of these specimens were previously not available for open study.Designing the User Interface for theFischlar Digital Video Library, by Lee and Smeaton, presents the designspace concept and framework for designing a video browser. User interfacesand query mechanisms of current video libraries are discussed, as wellas the design framework used in developing a keyframe-based video browserfor this video library project in Ireland.Yaron et al. detail the creation of interactive learning experiencesthrough the CreateStudio development environment. LinkedActive Content for Digital Libraries for Education demonstrates a principlethat has long been recognized in systems development: the need to separatecontent from software. In an information use context this allows for easierrepurposing of content to create new interactive learning experiences.The concept of interactivity through inquiry-based education is discussedby Moore et al. Active Netlib:An Active Mathematical Software Collection for Inquiry-based ComputationalScience and Engineering Education discusses executable mathematicalsoftware that both guides users in selecting appropriate software basedon the user’s needs, and assists users in setting correct parameters andinterpreting results.In Federated Searching Interface Techniquesfor Heterogeneous OAI Repositories, Liu et al. highlight theimportance of developing a rich unified search interface built on the metadataand controlled vocabularies used across heterogeneous digital library collections.They discuss problems that arise in creating a unified search interfacein Arc, a fully implemented system providing access to content from 75different data providers.Salampasis and Diamantaras, in ExperimentalUser-centered Evaluation of an Open Hypermedia System and Web Information-SeekingEnvironments, discuss information seeking strategies and environments.The use of a single search interface, such as the Web, for multiple searchstrategies is examined and compared with an interaction model based onmultiple user interfaces and search strategies used in parallel.We hope you enjoy the special issue and look forward to your responsesto The Challenge of building interactional digital libraries.AcknowledgementsWe acknowledge and appreciate the services of the 15 reviewers who helpedshape this special issue.

Learning spaces displaythe best information for learning in an optimal manner; they incorporateintelligent, interactive information retrieval, customized for or controlledby users' learning styles. They use instructional technology, which isconcerned with information layout and sequencing for user understandingand improvement of learning. They offer the promise of improving the learningof difficult, abstract concepts and skills such as scientific reasoningby incorporating the notion of information work (Sundaram 1996a, 1996b).Taxonomies of tasks and user behaviors in the context of disciplinary andgeneral learning are developed; scientific classifications and generalknowledge representation schemes are merged with tasks and learning outcomesto develop ontologies and information-use maps. The second challenge isto build learning spaces that go beyond the ability to retrieve information,and include the facility to customize and filter information, to get onlyrelevant documents, to adjust sequencing and presentation of informationaccording to learning theories, information-seeking and disciplinary usebehaviors. Thus, knowledge representation techniques that facilitate informationuse for learning tasks, information visualizations that transcend humanprocessing limitations, and user evaluation that is woven into design,play key roles in building learning spaces.3. Interaction Spaces. Winograd (2002, p. 260) questions thecurrent model of interaction architecture and device communication - basedon the standard figure of a user in front of a screen with a keyboard/pointingdevice - and argues for the need to evolve towards a different architectureof multiple users in interactive spaces. Dillon (2002) refers to this as'Ubiquity' or ‘We Want Information Where We Are'. Ubiquitous computersmay help reduce the problem of information overload (Weiser 2001). Informationaccess is a question of whether users get information from a device, whetherold devices may be modified to provide new functions, or whether we meetthe real challenge of freeing human users from the multiplicity of physicallylocated devices for information access. Therefore, the third challengeis to build such interaction spaces for digital libraries that both freethe user from physical limitations as well as provide the benefits of virtualinteractions (for example, asynchronous interactivity) and communitiesto digital libraries.The information-learning-interaction spaces challenge provides a frameworkand directs digital library research and development to the human ratherthan just the technical problems. It is also grounded in the realizationthat libraries, whether they are digital or traditional, are socially constructed,and that the values of a society are embodied in the use of a library.Are these challenges realistic? Are such interactional digital librariespossible? Can they be built for successful use? We invite the communityto discuss and explore. The papers in this issue show how current projectsand initiatives are handling some of the challenges.Hoban et al. in Virtual Telescopesin Education, present the philosophical and resulting technical approachesto the role of interactivity in digital libraries. They use interactivityto enable the participation of novices in the scientific process just asexpert astronomers do on a daily basis. Designing a customizable virtualobservatory is only one element in engaging learners in this process-drivenenvironment. To encourage them to participate in the scientific inquiryprocess, learners are guided through developing a research proposal, gatheringand analyzing data, drawing conclusions and developing a report on theirfindings.In Thematic Real-time EnvironmentalDistributed Data Services (THREDDS), Domenicoet al. discussthe characteristics of earth systems data and illustrate specialized visualizationand analysis tools being developed to allow the user to manipulate andinteract with earth systems data. A related paper,Atmospheric Visualization Collection: Developmentsin the NSDL by Klaus et al.,highlights the differences between public users and researchers in usingtheir visualization database of atmospheric data. It illustrates how incorporatinginteractive assessment and development activities into the learning environmentsencourages participation and establishes an interactive user-provider community.Clark et al. in DigitalArchive Network for Anthropology highlight the opportunity forinteractive digital collections in anthropology and discuss work beingdone to create an interactive virtual laboratory experience for people from all levels who haveinterests in anthropology. Capabilities for creating both two- and three-dimensionalmodels of materials that can be manipulated, allowing the user to takeprecise measurements, all enhance the experience and detailed study ofanthropological specimens. Further, they increase research accessibilityas some of these specimens were previously not available for open study.Designing the User Interface for theFischlar Digital Video Library, by Lee and Smeaton, presents the designspace concept and framework for designing a video browser. User interfacesand query mechanisms of current video libraries are discussed, as wellas the design framework used in developing a keyframe-based video browserfor this video library project in Ireland.Yaron et al. detail the creation of interactive learning experiencesthrough the CreateStudio development environment. LinkedActive Content for Digital Libraries for Education demonstrates a principlethat has long been recognized in systems development: the need to separatecontent from software. In an information use context this allows for easierrepurposing of content to create new interactive learning experiences.The concept of interactivity through inquiry-based education is discussedby Moore et al. Active Netlib:An Active Mathematical Software Collection for Inquiry-based ComputationalScience and Engineering Education discusses executable mathematicalsoftware that both guides users in selecting appropriate software basedon the user’s needs, and assists users in setting correct parameters andinterpreting results.In Federated Searching Interface Techniquesfor Heterogeneous OAI Repositories, Liu et al. highlight theimportance of developing a rich unified search interface built on the metadataand controlled vocabularies used across heterogeneous digital library collections.They discuss problems that arise in creating a unified search interfacein Arc, a fully implemented system providing access to content from 75different data providers.Salampasis and Diamantaras, in ExperimentalUser-centered Evaluation of an Open Hypermedia System and Web Information-SeekingEnvironments, discuss information seeking strategies and environments.The use of a single search interface, such as the Web, for multiple searchstrategies is examined and compared with an interaction model based onmultiple user interfaces and search strategies used in parallel.We hope you enjoy the special issue and look forward to your responsesto The Challenge of building interactional digital libraries.AcknowledgementsWe acknowledge and appreciate the services of the 15 reviewers who helpedshape this special issue. Many of them are experts in their areas and thetime commitments of refereeing could easily have dissuaded them from participating.Instead they were enthusiastic in their acceptance and provided thoughtful,timely feedback.

ADEPT Collections and Services - Anita ColemanADEPTCollections and ServicesCollections and ServicesModel Description: Develop auser-centric model of ADEPT collections and services. This determinationwill be delivered in the form of a single white paper whose writing willbe coordinated by Ray Smith. The document will have four major sections:AnitaColeman will write an overview and literature review, partly incooperation with DLESE, discussing issues faced by ADEPT in buildingcollections and associated services for learning environments, andpotential resolutions of these issues. This section will serve as afoundation for organizing and building teaching and learningcollections for ADEPT (and subsequent ingestion into ADL) by defining amodel teaching/learning collection. The issues to be discussed include,but are not limited to: definitions of educational collections,different levels of granularity of objects represented in suchcollections and their interrelationships, metadata for educationalobjects and collections, identification of the components andcharacteristics of collections in DLs for use in teaching/learningcontexts, and services available to users for accessing/usingcollection items. It will include concrete examples of ADEPTcollections.

This determinationwill be delivered in the form of a single white paper whose writing willbe coordinated by Ray Smith. The document will have four major sections:AnitaColeman will write an overview and literature review, partly incooperation with DLESE, discussing issues faced by ADEPT in buildingcollections and associated services for learning environments, andpotential resolutions of these issues. This section will serve as afoundation for organizing and building teaching and learningcollections for ADEPT (and subsequent ingestion into ADL) by defining amodel teaching/learning collection. The issues to be discussed include,but are not limited to: definitions of educational collections,different levels of granularity of objects represented in suchcollections and their interrelationships, metadata for educationalobjects and collections, identification of the components andcharacteristics of collections in DLs for use in teaching/learningcontexts, and services available to users for accessing/usingcollection items.

EIESC is moving to a survey that comes from the SCs. EIESCis seeking a volunteer from its committee as well as a representative from other SCsPossibility of having some money to help with an annual survey. But if it is ongoingcommittee responsibility, volunteer EIESC oversight will still be required. Graduatestudents should feel empowered to volunteer.Collections Assessment Metrics Taskforce (Anita Coleman for Judy Ridgway)Serves as a means for characterizing NSDL MR (subject, audience, format, learning resourcetype). Discovered wide variations in consistency. Used human labor and 2 machine methods.Currently stopped because too much effort was expended by volunteers.Tammy says there needs to be a mixed model where the EIESC does some work, settingparameters, but pay someone to do coding and testing and running of experiment.Possibility of future workshop on Collections Assessment. For example, setting parameters.Also, studying current collections assessment work. That last issue is probably a good onefor the survey. "Classification Approach"Liz mentioned that she has a funded project along these lines, that she's writing a paper.Tammy says purpose was just to characterize library because we didn't know.Do we still want to focus on the question, "How are collections growing and evolving?"

Open Access Federation for Library and Information Science:  dLIST and DL-HarvestSearch   |   Back Issues   |   Author Index   |  Title Index   |  Contents D-Lib MagazineDecember 2005Volume 11 Number 12ISSN 1082-9873Open Access Federation for Library and Information SciencedLIST and DL-Harvest  Anita ColemanSchool of Information Resources and Library ScienceUniversity of Arizona<asc@u.arizona.edu> Joseph RobackDepartment of Computer ScienceUniversity of Arizona<robackja@cs.arizona.edu>       AbstractSelf-archiving, the practice of depositing one's works in an OAI-compliant archive, is a key strategy for innovating scholarly communication and achieving open access.   DL-Harvest, a subject service for Library and Information (LIS), based on the aggregation of OAI-PMH compliant metadata from both institutional and disciplinary digital repositories, including dLIST, is described.   Additionally, results from two studies that explored LIS journal publishers' stances towards self-archiving as expressed in copyright transfer agreements (CTAs) and the scholarly communication behaviors of LIS scholars, with regard to self-archiving and searching, are presented and some implications for the development of federated subject services are highlightedIntroductionIn 2002, approximately a year after release, Van de Sompel and Lagoze (2002) reported optimistically about the acceptance of the Open Archives Initiative-Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) as a foundation for digital library interoperability.  Additionally, they highlighted the role of metadata, data providers and service providers as enabled by the OAI specification, and identified some of the services that could be built besides resource discovery:  longevity and risk management, personalization, and current awareness.Today, less than five years after the OAI-PMH release, the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) website has registered 328 data providers (i.e., open access archives or digital repositories) that comply with OAI-PMH (OAI, 2005).  OAIster (2005), a digital union catalog and an end-user data service harvests 575 OAI-compliant repositories.  While these numbers are striking, they don't reveal exactly how OAI-PMH is being used in "federating" institutional repositories "...a fruitful area for exploration and innovation" (Lynch, 2003).1   To do so, in this article we report our experiences as an OAI-PMH data provider of dLIST, the Digital Library of Information Science and Technology, an open access archive and a cross-institutional Eprints-based, digital repository for Library and Information Science (LIS).  Issues for OAI-PMH service providers are explained using our development of DL-Harvest, a subject-based, open access aggregator and search engine for the information sciences, including LIS. We describe the modifications we made to the PKP Harvester software with regard to OAI-PMH flow control and sets, and the 13 OAI-compliant archives we currently aggregate, particularly in terms of new services that can be developed.  Finally, we share the preliminary results of two studies.  The first analyzed the copyright transfer agreements (CTAs) of LIS journals, and the second explored the self-archiving and scholarly communication behaviors of LIS Scholars. Findings from these studies, we hope, will help LIS scholars, decision-makers and leaders demarcate the differences between scholarly communication and publishing, and support the development of subject services that  "create a much more open field for a widened circle of researchers." (Guedon, 2004, p. 325).Open Access in Library and Information ScienceOpen access archiving, sometimes also referred to as self-archiving, and open access publishing through open access journals are two complementary ways to accomplish open access of the scholarly, refereed, research literature and other outputs of a field.  For Harnad (2003), open access archives are the "green" and open access journals the "gold" roads to achieving open access of the refereed, research literature.  According to Suber (2005), "Open-access (OA) literature is digital, online, free of charge, and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions."  Open access to all the research outputs on a global scale is the goal of the OA movement (Harnad, (1995); BOAI, 2002), and many solutions to reach this goal exist (Hitchcock, 2003).  Yet, in 2002  although there were many experiments in open, electronic publishing  there were no open access archives for LIS.Despite quick support and advocacy of the OA movement from the LIS community, open access to their own research outputs, except possibly in the area of digital libraries, remained to be accomplished. Considering that the majority of the Thomson-ISI ranked journals in the Information Science, Library Science category were closed,2 this was a significant gap.  Hence, in June 2002 dLIST was established as a cross-institutional, disciplinary, open access archive to close the gap; scholars who were publishing in the closed journals now had an OAI-compliant venue for self-archiving.  dLIST was also a response to findings that were percolating even as early as 2002, the hallmark year when institutional repositories began to be adopted as a strategy for OA (Lynch 2003, Crow, 2003).  Not all institutions may be able to afford institutional repositories, scholars in general adhere to disciplines rather than institutions, all types of scholarly materials need to be open to foster a strong scholarly communication network, and there will continue to be a need for subject-based aggregation, federated searching, preservation, and other services (American OA Forum, 2003; Brogan, 2003; Guedon, 2004; Krichel, 1998; Lynch, 2003; Odlyzko, 2002).   Specific reasons for establishing dLIST as a subject archive, include the following:The relatively small size and location of many academic LIS units, in the United States and globally, means that they may not be able to afford their own institutional repositories; The importance of connecting the LIS education, research and practice communities by means of a digital library that besides research materials had curriculum (syllabi) and practice (pathfinders, information literacy) materials3 was recognized;  We sought to improve visibility and cumulate the disciplinary research record by providing a repository for preliminary research findings and supporting supplementary research materials such as bibliometric datasets and evaluation protocols; and We wished to work with professional, learned societies in the field to identify a sustainable business model for OA that positively affects LIS scholarly communication and maximizes economies of scale.    DL-Harvest, Aggregating Open Access LISDL-Harvest, a subject-based, open access aggregator and federated search service for LIS was established in May 2005.  It is indexed by Google and Google Scholar, besides OAIster.  Figures 1-3 are screenshots of DL-Harvest showing the archives harvested and the two types of searches (Quick/Basic and Advanced) that are available.  As a service for the Information Sciences, DL-Harvest aggregates materials from selected repositories in Archival Science, Library and Information Science, Museum Informatics, and related subjects.  Currently, metadata from 13 OAI-PMH data providers are gathered and offered with search services.For the harvesting software, we considered Old Dominion's ARC which we had used in another experiment to integrate non-OAI, structured websites (Coleman et al., 2004).  In the end we selected the Public Knowledge Project's Open Archives Metadata Harvester, henceforth referred to as PKP Harvester (2005).    (Kellog, (2004) provides a list of eight OAI Metadata Harvesting Tools including a brief evaluation of the PKP Harvester and Virginia Tech Perl Harvester.)  We selected PKP Harvester, despite its limitations, because of its ease of use and potential for scalability.  It uses PHP, a standard web/database programming language, one that is easily integrated on the Apache Web Server under which Eprints runs along with the MySQL database and the Linux operating system4.  PKP Harvester is also open source, which allows us to freely modify the PKP application software.The official PKP Harvester does not implement all of the OAI protocol; that is, it supports neither OAI flow control5 nor OAI sets6. To address this, we developed two software code patches for flow control and sets. Without flow control, it is impossible to harvest from archives like arXiv, and without sets, we would have to harvest all of arXiv's 100,000+ articles. We run DL-Harvest with these two patches, and the patches have also been submitted for inclusion in the next release of the PKP Harvester.   In the meantime, our patches are available at dLIST7 and are being used in new services8.  Additionally, the PKP Harvester offers little or no logging support, although standard UNIX logging can be integrated. This makes it difficult to diagnose problems with archives during harvesting; for example, answers are ambiguous to questions such as: Are the archives down, or are there just no new items?LIS Archives in DL-HarvestThe 13 archives in DL-Harvest are: @rchiveSIC, ArXiv, Australian National Library Association (ALIA), CalTech Library Systems Papers and Publications (Cal-Tech), D-Lib Magazine, E-LIS, Librarians Digital Library (LDL), OCLC Research Publications Repository, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, School of Information and Library Science Electronic Theses & Dissertations, and the WWW Conference Archive.  Table 1 provides a quick overview of the type of repository, the software used, the coverage in terms of years and language, alerting service availability, and repository size.  The policies of most of the archives with regard to metadata, collection, storage formats, preservation, user privacy, audience, services, and coverage in terms of language, types, subject, etc. are not readily discernible, which provides an area for collaboration, cooperation, and coordination as OAI data providers proliferate. The subject schemes used are diverse, and Table 2 summarizes the major types of self-developed subject schemes in the 13 archives.Table 1: Characteristics of DL-Harvest  ArchivesName of Archive (and type of repository, subject focus)Software UsedCoverage & ServicesTotal Number of itemsNumber of Full-Texts/Items in English in Multi-lingual Repositories**  LanguageDatesAlerts  @rchiveSIC(Cross-institutional, inter-disciplinary)EprintsFrench, English1993 - Yes62735AxXiv(Computing only, Cross-institutional, disciplinary, physics)Prop.English1993 - Yes6158-ALIA(Cross-institutional, disciplinary)EprintsEnglish2000 - No22-CalTech(Institutional, academic unit is the library)EprintsEnglish1999 - No35-D-Lib Magazine(Open access journal)Prop.English1995 - Yes319-DLIST(Cross-institutional, inter-disciplinary information sciences)EprintsEnglish1987 - Yes499-E-LIS(Cross-institutional, disciplinary, LIS)EprintsSpanish, French, Italian, Portuguese1965 - Yes2949781ERPAePRINTS(Project-based, cross-institutional, digital preservation)EprintsEnglish, Italian, etc.1995 - No4847LDL(Institutional, academic unit is LIS)DSpaceEnglish1999 - Yes188-OCLC(Institutional unit is the research dept.)EprintsEnglish1979 - No349-OpenMed(Cross-institutional, disciplinary, medical sciences)EprintsEnglish1952 - No749-UNC-SILS ETD(Institutional, academic unit is LIS)DSpaceEnglish2004 - No368-WWW Conference Archive(Conference papers from a single conference)EprintsEnglish2001 - No504-**These numbers are based on DL-Harvest as of 1 November 2005. Table 2.

An Advanced Search, which allows several fielded searching by Archive, Author, Subject, Date ranges,  or Language.  The search is a full-text search on the metadata in the database9 and matches other non-text fields on a one-to-one basis. DL-Harvest is using the PKP search software, but PKP-out-of-the-box was not only simple, some search functions did not work.  We upgraded our MySQL to use a newer version 4.1.x, added SQL query optimizations (some MySQL4 specific) to our search interface, and modified the PKP search software by completely rewriting the code for the Advanced Search.  Our modifications improve the search services and allow for greater performance when the number of archives increases. At a low number of archives, say <50,000, these optimizations don't affect the user's perception of the  search.Liu et al. (2001) note, "The effort of maintaining a quality federation service is highly dependent on the quality of the data providers."  They mention four problems:Data provider and metadata quality. Not all data providers follow the OAI-PMH protocol and thus some provide accurate metadata, but there are others who don't provide any metadata or incomplete metadata. Update frequency, push model, and security. Too many harvests might burden the data provider while too few means the service provider's data may be stale. Availability of data providers. The need for controlled vocabularies for cross-archive subject searches.  We note a fifth problem: the way sets are described may be a limitation of the OAI-PMH protocol for setting up subject services and Tennant (n.d) has also documented these and others.Sets are defined by the OAI archive or data provider not by the harvester software of the service provider. This limits the selection that harvesters have when harvesting. (One advantage to this, or any other OAI defined filter, is that the data transfer and harvester processing time are reduced, because the archive does not return unwanted data.). One way to get around this problem is for the harvester to implement its own filters. Basically, the harvester could implement search criteria (after harvesting) and filter out metadata that either match or don't match  specified criteria. A simple example would be to filter out metadata that doesn't match a certain subject. Similarly, if one didn't want metadata created/modified before January 1, 1990, a filter could simply look at the date field in the metadata and ignore metadata before 1990. The drawback (but possibly also an advantage) with this approach is that each harvester could implement the filtering in its own way, instead of combining all efforts into improving it in the OAI protocol.  We have experimented with sets for one archive  namely, the well-known arXiv for not only physics but also computer science and including the digital libraries and information retrieval communities.  DL-Harvest only harvests the Computer Science set from this archive, making available approximately 6,158 metadata records for searching.  We hope to refine harvesting of arXiv even further and harvest only specific subjects such as Digital Libraries, Human-Computer Interaction, and Information Retrieval.  For now, the DL-Harvest Advanced Search subject filter limits for these subjects at time of searching.Using examples from DL-Harvest searches, limitations of data provided, and new subject services that are needed for globally inclusive scholarly communication networks, are described in terms of language, dates, subjects, authors, and resource types.LanguageDL-Harvest indexes three archives that allow materials in languages other than English:  @rchiveSIC, E-LIS, and ERPAePRINTS.  8,978 of the 12,815 items now in DL-Harvest are in English; this means that about 4,000 materials are in other languages.  In DL-Harvest, these other language materials can be retrieved using Advanced Search and limiting by language for All Archives or in individual archives.   Example: In Advanced Search, selecting @rchiveSIC, and entering the code "en" in the Language field, and leaving all other fields empty will retrieve 35 records (all in English) out of the total of 626.  A similar search in E-LIS retrieves 781 English language works from the total of 2,949.  Data providers can improve their search capabilities by offering language filters, but neither @rchiveSIC nor E-LIS currently offer them.  This is another reason for scholars-as-readers to use a subject-based service like DL-Harvest.  A service for either DL-Harvest or the individual data providers to explore is the provision of English versions of summaries and references, at the very least, if not the full-text of the entire document itself.  Translations improve accessibility to open access materials in other languages.DatesThe DL-Harvest metadata record date for the title, "Activity-based classification of university actors for the construction of a domain-oriented data warehouse" from @rchiveSIC displays as 2006-07-2710.  Currently, it is unclear  from the record display whether this is date of publication or something else, though further investigation shows that this is the publication date.  The metadata record display needs improvement, but it is not always clear that all data providers are using the date field consistently.   Another scenario can be seen in the metadata from D-Lib Magazine and OCLC Research Publications Repository.  Dates for all titles in these archives display as December 31, 196911 because the archive (data provider) returns a NULL date for these two sources, and hence this field defaults to the lowest date allowed in the MySQL datetime field, 12.31.1969. This is another type of data that needs to be cleaned.Subject, Discipline, TopicEach archive uses a different scheme for subjects.  Also, 10 of the 13 archives (exceptions are dLIST, LDL, and WWW Conference Archive) use subject and discipline metadata.  Sometimes other fields with subject metadata are also present: Keywords and Approach.  Finally, the subject fields are not used consistently in the archives.  For example, in arXiv the phrase "digital libraries" is both a subject and a discipline12.  The lack of a shared controlled vocabulary across repositories means that service providers and data providers need to collaborate.  More experimentation is needed with regard to automatic and human-mediated metadata generation and enhancement, and full-text indexing in these contexts.NamesA Quick Search for "Marchionini" in All, retrieves 27 records; picking the name up in both the author and contributor metadata fields. A Quick Search of "Marchionini" as an Author search retrieves only two records.   As the archives grow, distinguishing between author roles, name searching and disambiguation will become important.   Names can also be included as part of an alerting service to notify users of additions; for example, we are currently experimenting with RSS feeds by subject for DL-Harvest and dLIST13. Users can use web browsers, such as Mozilla Firefox and Apple Safari, standalone RSS feed readers or those embedded in mail clients like Thunderbird, and become notified of new materials submitted to dLIST by reading the feeds that include links to the original item.    Currently, the dLIST RSS feed notifies users of all additions; there's no facility for receiving only RSS feeds when materials in selected subjects of interest are added or specific scholars deposit.   Similarly, RSS-enabled feeds for DL-Harvest by subject, author names, and user-specified searches are added-value services.TypesMost LIS data currently tends to be text based formats (HTML, PDF).  However, datasets (spreadsheet data) and other types of data and information objects such as multimedia files are finding their way into the archives improving the scope for the development of services based on resource types besides traditional bibliographic management (reference lists) and alerts, such as re-use, storage and preservation, search services for multimedia, and annotation/commentary. Adding communication tools to facilitate discussions of deposits, processing tools to manipulate specific types of resources self-archived, visualization and certification (online peer review processes for improving quality, increasing trust and reducing information overload) are value-added services. These have great potential for changing scholarly communication and enabling new forms of scholarship.Figure 1:  DL-Harvest and the list of 13 archives currently being harvested.  Figure 2:  Simple search screen in DL-Harvest; there is also an Advanced Search option as the spotlight shows.  Figure 3:  Advanced Search Screen - showing all fields - in DL-Harvest.The Practice of Self-Archiving in LISAs we continue to develop dLIST as a cross-institutional repository for self-archiving and DL-Harvest, as a subject service, the practices of the communities we serve are also of great interest. Two studies, the dLIST Copyright Transfer Agreements (CTAs) analysis and the dLIST Scholarly Communication survey were undertaken in order to understand LIS publishers' stances as expressed in journal copyrights and the behaviors of LIS scholars as authors and readers.What are the self-archiving policies reflected in the CTAs of LIS journals?  Harnad (2005) has persuasively argued against analyzing journal copyright policies in great detail. However, for LIS, the copyright barrier faced by authors must be examined in detail because our field is not just limited to scholarship in a particular subject; many are devoted to research about scholarly communication itself and being informed about the nuances of self-archiving is important for the subsequent health of the discipline.  The self-archiving definition is not quite as cut and dried as we think and this has implications for building research communities and improving individual and field impact through economies of scale.  Swan's study (2005) for example included definitions that ranged from the deposit of only scholarly works on a personal website to deposit inOAI-compliant archives.We defined self-archiving quite rigorously as the "practice of depositing digital copies of papers or other scholarly works in an OAI-compliant repository."  The RoMEO/SHERPA classification of publishers by color based on their support of self-archiving (Gadd et al., 2003) was modified in our data analysis to reflect both which version of a paper could be self-archived and where it could be self-archived.   A dLIST CTA directory showing the CTA location and interpreting the self-archiving stance is available for testing14.  Figures 4-5 are sample entries from the directory for two journals:  Information Research and Information Systems Journal, and a brief summary of what we found follows:Of the 52 English-language, Thomson-Scientific ranked journals (Social Science Citation Index, Information Science, Library Science category), only two are open access journals: Journal of the Medical Library Association and Information Research.Even journals that allow self-archiving of postprints (see the case of the entry shown in Figure 5) can be ambiguous or contradictory, leading the poor author to give up on the notion of depositing anything other than a preprint anywhere other than his website!To add to the complexity, publishers use different names for the CTA: Author or Publisher Agreement, Copyright Agreement, Journal Article Record (Emerald), Transfer of Copyright Agreement (Elsevier, Taylor & Francis), License (ALA).  More importantly, it became impossible to limit the analysis to the CTAs since many of them reference other documents.  For example, Journal of Documentation references the Author's Charter.  Again, Figure 5 shows the presence of a separate self-archiving page.Many LIS journals do not have a CTA available on the Web. CTA analysis is a moving target; many journals changed policies even as we were carrying out the study, making data reported as recently as August 2005 no longer valid a few months later; for example, in November College & Research Libraries became an open access journal with a 6-month embargo period and permits the immediate self-archiving of preprints and postprints.Figure 4: Sample entry for an  ISI-ranked open access journalJournal URL:http://informationr.net/ir/Subject:Library and Information ScienceType:In ISI JCR, in ISI-SSCI, In DOAJPublisher:Lund University Libraries and University of Sheffield, Dept. of Information StudiesPublisher URL:http://www.lub.lu.se/new_top/omlub/bd_eng.htmlCTA URL:http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd-nc/1.0/Date:02/25/2005Last Update:11/09/2005Special Notes:"You are free: to copy, distribute, display, and perform the work Under the following conditions: Attribution.

Author can archive in open access archives. Author can archive pre-print and post-printNotes:Blackwell has a separate self-archiving page on its website which contradicts condition (b) above - http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/static/selfarchive.asp. According to it, 1) Authors are allowed to self-archive preprints and postprints in OAA but 2) postprints may have an embargo period depending on journal.  The CTA for ISJ mentions no embargo period.Our analysis of the ISI-ranked LIS journals shows that irrespective of the type of publisher (learned societies, university presses, or commercial), many do not make their self-archiving stance unambiguously visible. Annual Review of Information Science and Technology, Canadian Journal of Library and Information Science, Libraries & Culture, and Library Quarterly, are only a few of the professional society and university press journals that make no statement endorsing self-archiving, nor is a CTA publicly available for any of them. Journal of the American Society for Information Science & Technology (published by Wiley for ASIS&T) prohibits "systematic external distribution" but what exactly this means is called into question by the CTAs of other publishers.  On the other hand, commercially produced journals like Journal of Documentation (Emerald Publishing Group), Information Systems Journal (Blackwell), and Serials Review (Elsevier) appear to announce their self-archiving policies publicly  albeit ambiguously. Elsevier journals still don't make their CTA publicly available but Elsevier has a Copyright Policy document web document; Blackwell's Information Systems Journal, as we saw in Figure 5, has contradictory elements. Journals published by Emerald appear to prohibit self-archiving in open access archives at first glance of the CTA, but a reading of related documents like Emerald's Author's Charter reveals that self-archiving is permitted. Leadership from major professional associations in the US and Canada, such as the American Library Association, American Society for Information Science & Technology and Canadian Association for Information Science, has been slow. The Medical Library Association, on the other hand, signaled early and clearly; their journal went open in 2001/2002, and all back issues are openly available from 1911 onwards. The majority of LIS journals, we speculate, are not averse to self-archiving although LIS scholars, in general, don't appear to be aware of this, and how much LIS scholars-as-authors can self-archive in an OAI-compliant archive is still not crystal clear. Whether all LIS scholars hold the same definition of self-archiving as we do, how much they self-archive, and their strategies for locating content in open archives are questions the 2005 dLIST survey on self-archiving and scholarly communication in LIS sought to understand.The online survey of the scholarly communication behaviors of LIS scholars focused on self-archiving, and the instrument was adapted from Swan and Brown (2005).  The complete instrument, showing all the questions in the survey, has been self-archived in dLIST (Coleman, 2005), and we report only a few relevant, preliminary findings here.Two hundred forty-four usable responses were received.  Ninety-nine of the 244 respondents were faculty in LIS schools.  One hundred thirty-one defined self-archiving, but only 3 (n=131) corroborated ours by mentioning deposit in an OAI-compliant archive as their definition of self-archiving.  While 55.1% (70 of n=127) said they self-archive, only 17 (n=72) admitted they self-archive in dLIST.  Where do the rest self-archive? The majority, 27 (n=40), deposit their papers on their personal website, shared-network drive, or laptop, 9 self-archive in institutional repositories, 3 self-archive in E-LIS, and 1 self-archives in Social Science Research Network.  Twenty-four (n=55) were unaware of the possibility of providing open access through self-archiving. Reasons for not self-archiving ranged from lack of time, lack of acceptance ("most of the scholars cite paid articles from paid journals only"), lack of institutional support, and lack of integration with workflow tools like "Google", as well as concerns about copyright and peer review.  A few candidly admitted, "don't know how." Another wrote: "I feel guilty not using dLIST. Find a way to make it easier and I'll participate." Many revealed understanding and support of dLIST goals to connect LIS research, education and practice communities through a disciplinary service for all types of scholarly work:  "I like how any type of work can be archived...journal articles, teaching materials..."; "mention D-LIST as a self-archiving option, esp. for those with no institutional repository, very frequently."Eleven respondents use DL-Harvest to search for content in open access archives (n=106) and, not surprisingly, the majority, 84, used Google Scholar.  Finally, respondents had more questions than answers, as this quote from a single participant shows: "How can I do it? What is it? Where can I get it done? Will I have versioning control? Do I lose control of the article after I post it? How do I update as information changes? How do people who are using the archive know that something has been updated on an article they have read in the past? How can I create connections between my articles, or between my articles and other people's articles? What kind of visualizations and search interfaces are used to get people to my articles? How are they abstracted? Can I write my own dLIST specific abstract for display/browsing purposes? Who uses dLIST? Why would anyone bother? Am I wasting my time by putting my article there? How integrated with other services is dLIST? Is it indexed by Google and other search engines? If not, why not? Are there other ways I can access articles in dLIST without disrupting my workflow by going to dLIST's webpage or whatever interface exists? How does it work? How is an article's relevancy to a particular search evaluated? How are search results returned?"ConclusionClearly there is a great deal of work to be done  more educational or advocacy than technical  if federated OAI-compliant archives and services are to achieve the economies of scale that OCLC did for cataloging, or that stimulate the sort of innovations that ISI citation indexes enabled.  Despite comments such as "dLIST is a wonderful espace" and "DL-Harvest is a much needed subject service", the low rate of actual self-archiving raises the question of the value of dLIST and DL-Harvest. How much access to the closed literature are they providing, and what new forms of scholarship or innovation are they facilitating?.Besides sparking innovation and economies of scale subject aggregation and subsequent federation has the potential to bridge islands of disparities  in this case, the many research communities and their collections that can be gathered under an LIS umbrella. But how close to this are we? The preceding discussion has implicitly assumed that data and service providers have niche roles; data providers offer self-archiving in an OAI-compliant repository. They build communities and may experiment to offer simpler deposit and metadata interfaces, as well as facilitate bulk-imports to make self-archiving easier for users. Far-sighted data providers may also link to services such as DL-Harvest and improve their individual institutional repository visibility and accessibility. Translations, current awareness alerts, certification (peer review, trust), and reports of usage (downloading) and impact (citing services) may contribute to shared developments with service providers. Service providers may build yet more federated and customized services. However, this might not happen. Uncoordinated institutional repositories in LIS may inhibit collaborative development and scholarly use of non-commercial OA subject services; roles may become blurred. Scholars and professional associations in LIS should think strategically about the development of repositories and subject federated services, because doing so may also improve public perceptions and funding for the field (Armbruster, 2005).AcknowledgementsThanks to Richard Hill and Carol Tenopir for insightful comments on an early draft. Thanks, also, to everyone who completed the dLIST 2005 survey and especially those who self-archive in OAI repositories.

Back issues, 1911 on, are openly available through PubMed.3 This does not mean that all the different materials must be in the collection or even use the same repository software; we envisioned working with communities on an as-needed basis.4 As Kellog (2004) notes, the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) is the chosen platform for some of the largest web services: Amazon, Paypal, Slashdot, and Google.5 <http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html#FlowControl>6 <http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html#ListSets>7 <http://dlist.sir.arizona.edu/downloads.html>8 DAEDALUS, a scholarly communication project at the University of Glasgow Library, <http://www.lib.gla.ac.uk/daedalus/> and Collib, a Master's LIS project in Norway, <http://collib.info/>.9 <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/full-text-search.html>10 URL: <http://dlharvest.sir.arizona.edu/viewrecord.php?id=19732>11 URL: <http://dlharvest.sir.arizona.edu/archives.php?id=18> and URL: <http://dlharvest.sir.arizona.edu/archives.php?id=14>12 URL: <http://dlharvest.sir.arizona.edu/viewrecord.php?id=19102> and  URL: <http://dlharvest.sir.arizona.edu/viewrecord.php?id=18532>.13	Kristin Eschenfelder (University of Wisconsin at Madison) suggested the subject RSS  alerting service.14 <http://dLIST.sir.arizona.edu/cta>ReferencesAmerican Scientist Open Access Forum.

DL-Harvest, a subject service for Library and Information (LIS), based on the aggregation of OAI-PMH compliant metadata from both institutional and disciplinary digital repositories, including dLIST, is described.   Additionally, results from two studies that explored LIS journal publishers' stances towards self-archiving as expressed in copyright transfer agreements (CTAs) and the scholarly communication behaviors of LIS scholars, with regard to self-archiving and searching, are presented and some implications for the development of federated subject services are highlightedIntroductionIn 2002, approximately a year after release, Van de Sompel and Lagoze (2002) reported optimistically about the acceptance of the Open Archives Initiative-Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) as a foundation for digital library interoperability.  Additionally, they highlighted the role of metadata, data providers and service providers as enabled by the OAI specification, and identified some of the services that could be built besides resource discovery:  longevity and risk management, personalization, and current awareness.Today, less than five years after the OAI-PMH release, the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) website has registered 328 data providers (i.e., open access archives or digital repositories) that comply with OAI-PMH (OAI, 2005).  OAIster (2005), a digital union catalog and an end-user data service harvests 575 OAI-compliant repositories.  While these numbers are striking, they don't reveal exactly how OAI-PMH is being used in "federating" institutional repositories "...a fruitful area for exploration and innovation" (Lynch, 2003).1   To do so, in this article we report our experiences as an OAI-PMH data provider of dLIST, the Digital Library of Information Science and Technology, an open access archive and a cross-institutional Eprints-based, digital repository for Library and Information Science (LIS).  Issues for OAI-PMH service providers are explained using our development of DL-Harvest, a subject-based, open access aggregator and search engine for the information sciences, including LIS. We describe the modifications we made to the PKP Harvester software with regard to OAI-PMH flow control and sets, and the 13 OAI-compliant archives we currently aggregate, particularly in terms of new services that can be developed.  Finally, we share the preliminary results of two studies.  The first analyzed the copyright transfer agreements (CTAs) of LIS journals, and the second explored the self-archiving and scholarly communication behaviors of LIS Scholars. Findings from these studies, we hope, will help LIS scholars, decision-makers and leaders demarcate the differences between scholarly communication and publishing, and support the development of subject services that  "create a much more open field for a widened circle of researchers." (Guedon, 2004, p. 325).Open Access in Library and Information ScienceOpen access archiving, sometimes also referred to as self-archiving, and open access publishing through open access journals are two complementary ways to accomplish open access of the scholarly, refereed, research literature and other outputs of a field.  For Harnad (2003), open access archives are the "green" and open access journals the "gold" roads to achieving open access of the refereed, research literature.  According to Suber (2005), "Open-access (OA) literature is digital, online, free of charge, and free of most copyright and licensing restrictions."  Open access to all the research outputs on a global scale is the goal of the OA movement (Harnad, (1995); BOAI, 2002), and many solutions to reach this goal exist (Hitchcock, 2003).  Yet, in 2002  although there were many experiments in open, electronic publishing  there were no open access archives for LIS.Despite quick support and advocacy of the OA movement from the LIS community, open access to their own research outputs, except possibly in the area of digital libraries, remained to be accomplished. Considering that the majority of the Thomson-ISI ranked journals in the Information Science, Library Science category were closed,2 this was a significant gap.  Hence, in June 2002 dLIST was established as a cross-institutional, disciplinary, open access archive to close the gap; scholars who were publishing in the closed journals now had an OAI-compliant venue for self-archiving.  dLIST was also a response to findings that were percolating even as early as 2002, the hallmark year when institutional repositories began to be adopted as a strategy for OA (Lynch 2003, Crow, 2003).  Not all institutions may be able to afford institutional repositories, scholars in general adhere to disciplines rather than institutions, all types of scholarly materials need to be open to foster a strong scholarly communication network, and there will continue to be a need for subject-based aggregation, federated searching, preservation, and other services (American OA Forum, 2003; Brogan, 2003; Guedon, 2004; Krichel, 1998; Lynch, 2003; Odlyzko, 2002).   Specific reasons for establishing dLIST as a subject archive, include the following:The relatively small size and location of many academic LIS units, in the United States and globally, means that they may not be able to afford their own institutional repositories; The importance of connecting the LIS education, research and practice communities by means of a digital library that besides research materials had curriculum (syllabi) and practice (pathfinders, information literacy) materials3 was recognized;  We sought to improve visibility and cumulate the disciplinary research record by providing a repository for preliminary research findings and supporting supplementary research materials such as bibliometric datasets and evaluation protocols; and We wished to work with professional, learned societies in the field to identify a sustainable business model for OA that positively affects LIS scholarly communication and maximizes economies of scale.    DL-Harvest, Aggregating Open Access LISDL-Harvest, a subject-based, open access aggregator and federated search service for LIS was established in May 2005.  It is indexed by Google and Google Scholar, besides OAIster.  Figures 1-3 are screenshots of DL-Harvest showing the archives harvested and the two types of searches (Quick/Basic and Advanced) that are available.  As a service for the Information Sciences, DL-Harvest aggregates materials from selected repositories in Archival Science, Library and Information Science, Museum Informatics, and related subjects.  Currently, metadata from 13 OAI-PMH data providers are gathered and offered with search services.For the harvesting software, we considered Old Dominion's ARC which we had used in another experiment to integrate non-OAI, structured websites (Coleman et al., 2004).  In the end we selected the Public Knowledge Project's Open Archives Metadata Harvester, henceforth referred to as PKP Harvester (2005).    (Kellog, (2004) provides a list of eight OAI Metadata Harvesting Tools including a brief evaluation of the PKP Harvester and Virginia Tech Perl Harvester.)  We selected PKP Harvester, despite its limitations, because of its ease of use and potential for scalability.  It uses PHP, a standard web/database programming language, one that is easily integrated on the Apache Web Server under which Eprints runs along with the MySQL database and the Linux operating system4.  PKP Harvester is also open source, which allows us to freely modify the PKP application software.The official PKP Harvester does not implement all of the OAI protocol; that is, it supports neither OAI flow control5 nor OAI sets6. To address this, we developed two software code patches for flow control and sets. Without flow control, it is impossible to harvest from archives like arXiv, and without sets, we would have to harvest all of arXiv's 100,000+ articles. We run DL-Harvest with these two patches, and the patches have also been submitted for inclusion in the next release of the PKP Harvester.   In the meantime, our patches are available at dLIST7 and are being used in new services8.  Additionally, the PKP Harvester offers little or no logging support, although standard UNIX logging can be integrated. This makes it difficult to diagnose problems with archives during harvesting; for example, answers are ambiguous to questions such as: Are the archives down, or are there just no new items?LIS Archives in DL-HarvestThe 13 archives in DL-Harvest are: @rchiveSIC, ArXiv, Australian National Library Association (ALIA), CalTech Library Systems Papers and Publications (Cal-Tech), D-Lib Magazine, E-LIS, Librarians Digital Library (LDL), OCLC Research Publications Repository, University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, School of Information and Library Science Electronic Theses & Dissertations, and the WWW Conference Archive.  Table 1 provides a quick overview of the type of repository, the software used, the coverage in terms of years and language, alerting service availability, and repository size.  The policies of most of the archives with regard to metadata, collection, storage formats, preservation, user privacy, audience, services, and coverage in terms of language, types, subject, etc. are not readily discernible, which provides an area for collaboration, cooperation, and coordination as OAI data providers proliferate. The subject schemes used are diverse, and Table 2 summarizes the major types of self-developed subject schemes in the 13 archives.Table 1: Characteristics of DL-Harvest  ArchivesName of Archive (and type of repository, subject focus)Software UsedCoverage & ServicesTotal Number of itemsNumber of Full-Texts/Items in English in Multi-lingual Repositories**  LanguageDatesAlerts  @rchiveSIC(Cross-institutional, inter-disciplinary)EprintsFrench, English1993 - Yes62735AxXiv(Computing only, Cross-institutional, disciplinary, physics)Prop.English1993 - Yes6158-ALIA(Cross-institutional, disciplinary)EprintsEnglish2000 - No22-CalTech(Institutional, academic unit is the library)EprintsEnglish1999 - No35-D-Lib Magazine(Open access journal)Prop.English1995 - Yes319-DLIST(Cross-institutional, inter-disciplinary information sciences)EprintsEnglish1987 - Yes499-E-LIS(Cross-institutional, disciplinary, LIS)EprintsSpanish, French, Italian, Portuguese1965 - Yes2949781ERPAePRINTS(Project-based, cross-institutional, digital preservation)EprintsEnglish, Italian, etc.1995 - No4847LDL(Institutional, academic unit is LIS)DSpaceEnglish1999 - Yes188-OCLC(Institutional unit is the research dept.)EprintsEnglish1979 - No349-OpenMed(Cross-institutional, disciplinary, medical sciences)EprintsEnglish1952 - No749-UNC-SILS ETD(Institutional, academic unit is LIS)DSpaceEnglish2004 - No368-WWW Conference Archive(Conference papers from a single conference)EprintsEnglish2001 - No504-**These numbers are based on DL-Harvest as of 1 November 2005. Table 2.

An Advanced Search, which allows several fielded searching by Archive, Author, Subject, Date ranges,  or Language.  The search is a full-text search on the metadata in the database9 and matches other non-text fields on a one-to-one basis. DL-Harvest is using the PKP search software, but PKP-out-of-the-box was not only simple, some search functions did not work.  We upgraded our MySQL to use a newer version 4.1.x, added SQL query optimizations (some MySQL4 specific) to our search interface, and modified the PKP search software by completely rewriting the code for the Advanced Search.  Our modifications improve the search services and allow for greater performance when the number of archives increases. At a low number of archives, say <50,000, these optimizations don't affect the user's perception of the  search.Liu et al. (2001) note, "The effort of maintaining a quality federation service is highly dependent on the quality of the data providers."  They mention four problems:Data provider and metadata quality. Not all data providers follow the OAI-PMH protocol and thus some provide accurate metadata, but there are others who don't provide any metadata or incomplete metadata. Update frequency, push model, and security. Too many harvests might burden the data provider while too few means the service provider's data may be stale. Availability of data providers. The need for controlled vocabularies for cross-archive subject searches.  We note a fifth problem: the way sets are described may be a limitation of the OAI-PMH protocol for setting up subject services and Tennant (n.d) has also documented these and others.Sets are defined by the OAI archive or data provider not by the harvester software of the service provider. This limits the selection that harvesters have when harvesting. (One advantage to this, or any other OAI defined filter, is that the data transfer and harvester processing time are reduced, because the archive does not return unwanted data.). One way to get around this problem is for the harvester to implement its own filters. Basically, the harvester could implement search criteria (after harvesting) and filter out metadata that either match or don't match  specified criteria. A simple example would be to filter out metadata that doesn't match a certain subject. Similarly, if one didn't want metadata created/modified before January 1, 1990, a filter could simply look at the date field in the metadata and ignore metadata before 1990. The drawback (but possibly also an advantage) with this approach is that each harvester could implement the filtering in its own way, instead of combining all efforts into improving it in the OAI protocol.  We have experimented with sets for one archive  namely, the well-known arXiv for not only physics but also computer science and including the digital libraries and information retrieval communities.  DL-Harvest only harvests the Computer Science set from this archive, making available approximately 6,158 metadata records for searching.  We hope to refine harvesting of arXiv even further and harvest only specific subjects such as Digital Libraries, Human-Computer Interaction, and Information Retrieval.  For now, the DL-Harvest Advanced Search subject filter limits for these subjects at time of searching.Using examples from DL-Harvest searches, limitations of data provided, and new subject services that are needed for globally inclusive scholarly communication networks, are described in terms of language, dates, subjects, authors, and resource types.LanguageDL-Harvest indexes three archives that allow materials in languages other than English:  @rchiveSIC, E-LIS, and ERPAePRINTS.  8,978 of the 12,815 items now in DL-Harvest are in English; this means that about 4,000 materials are in other languages.  In DL-Harvest, these other language materials can be retrieved using Advanced Search and limiting by language for All Archives or in individual archives.   Example: In Advanced Search, selecting @rchiveSIC, and entering the code "en" in the Language field, and leaving all other fields empty will retrieve 35 records (all in English) out of the total of 626.  A similar search in E-LIS retrieves 781 English language works from the total of 2,949.  Data providers can improve their search capabilities by offering language filters, but neither @rchiveSIC nor E-LIS currently offer them.  This is another reason for scholars-as-readers to use a subject-based service like DL-Harvest.  A service for either DL-Harvest or the individual data providers to explore is the provision of English versions of summaries and references, at the very least, if not the full-text of the entire document itself.  Translations improve accessibility to open access materials in other languages.DatesThe DL-Harvest metadata record date for the title, "Activity-based classification of university actors for the construction of a domain-oriented data warehouse" from @rchiveSIC displays as 2006-07-2710.  Currently, it is unclear  from the record display whether this is date of publication or something else, though further investigation shows that this is the publication date.  The metadata record display needs improvement, but it is not always clear that all data providers are using the date field consistently.   Another scenario can be seen in the metadata from D-Lib Magazine and OCLC Research Publications Repository.  Dates for all titles in these archives display as December 31, 196911 because the archive (data provider) returns a NULL date for these two sources, and hence this field defaults to the lowest date allowed in the MySQL datetime field, 12.31.1969. This is another type of data that needs to be cleaned.Subject, Discipline, TopicEach archive uses a different scheme for subjects.  Also, 10 of the 13 archives (exceptions are dLIST, LDL, and WWW Conference Archive) use subject and discipline metadata.  Sometimes other fields with subject metadata are also present: Keywords and Approach.  Finally, the subject fields are not used consistently in the archives.  For example, in arXiv the phrase "digital libraries" is both a subject and a discipline12.  The lack of a shared controlled vocabulary across repositories means that service providers and data providers need to collaborate.  More experimentation is needed with regard to automatic and human-mediated metadata generation and enhancement, and full-text indexing in these contexts.NamesA Quick Search for "Marchionini" in All, retrieves 27 records; picking the name up in both the author and contributor metadata fields. A Quick Search of "Marchionini" as an Author search retrieves only two records.   As the archives grow, distinguishing between author roles, name searching and disambiguation will become important.   Names can also be included as part of an alerting service to notify users of additions; for example, we are currently experimenting with RSS feeds by subject for DL-Harvest and dLIST13. Users can use web browsers, such as Mozilla Firefox and Apple Safari, standalone RSS feed readers or those embedded in mail clients like Thunderbird, and become notified of new materials submitted to dLIST by reading the feeds that include links to the original item.    Currently, the dLIST RSS feed notifies users of all additions; there's no facility for receiving only RSS feeds when materials in selected subjects of interest are added or specific scholars deposit.   Similarly, RSS-enabled feeds for DL-Harvest by subject, author names, and user-specified searches are added-value services.TypesMost LIS data currently tends to be text based formats (HTML, PDF).  However, datasets (spreadsheet data) and other types of data and information objects such as multimedia files are finding their way into the archives improving the scope for the development of services based on resource types besides traditional bibliographic management (reference lists) and alerts, such as re-use, storage and preservation, search services for multimedia, and annotation/commentary. Adding communication tools to facilitate discussions of deposits, processing tools to manipulate specific types of resources self-archived, visualization and certification (online peer review processes for improving quality, increasing trust and reducing information overload) are value-added services. These have great potential for changing scholarly communication and enabling new forms of scholarship.Figure 1:  DL-Harvest and the list of 13 archives currently being harvested.  Figure 2:  Simple search screen in DL-Harvest; there is also an Advanced Search option as the spotlight shows.  Figure 3:  Advanced Search Screen - showing all fields - in DL-Harvest.The Practice of Self-Archiving in LISAs we continue to develop dLIST as a cross-institutional repository for self-archiving and DL-Harvest, as a subject service, the practices of the communities we serve are also of great interest. Two studies, the dLIST Copyright Transfer Agreements (CTAs) analysis and the dLIST Scholarly Communication survey were undertaken in order to understand LIS publishers' stances as expressed in journal copyrights and the behaviors of LIS scholars as authors and readers.What are the self-archiving policies reflected in the CTAs of LIS journals?  Harnad (2005) has persuasively argued against analyzing journal copyright policies in great detail. However, for LIS, the copyright barrier faced by authors must be examined in detail because our field is not just limited to scholarship in a particular subject; many are devoted to research about scholarly communication itself and being informed about the nuances of self-archiving is important for the subsequent health of the discipline.  The self-archiving definition is not quite as cut and dried as we think and this has implications for building research communities and improving individual and field impact through economies of scale.  Swan's study (2005) for example included definitions that ranged from the deposit of only scholarly works on a personal website to deposit inOAI-compliant archives.We defined self-archiving quite rigorously as the "practice of depositing digital copies of papers or other scholarly works in an OAI-compliant repository."  The RoMEO/SHERPA classification of publishers by color based on their support of self-archiving (Gadd et al., 2003) was modified in our data analysis to reflect both which version of a paper could be self-archived and where it could be self-archived.   A dLIST CTA directory showing the CTA location and interpreting the self-archiving stance is available for testing14.  Figures 4-5 are sample entries from the directory for two journals:  Information Research and Information Systems Journal, and a brief summary of what we found follows:Of the 52 English-language, Thomson-Scientific ranked journals (Social Science Citation Index, Information Science, Library Science category), only two are open access journals: Journal of the Medical Library Association and Information Research.Even journals that allow self-archiving of postprints (see the case of the entry shown in Figure 5) can be ambiguous or contradictory, leading the poor author to give up on the notion of depositing anything other than a preprint anywhere other than his website!To add to the complexity, publishers use different names for the CTA: Author or Publisher Agreement, Copyright Agreement, Journal Article Record (Emerald), Transfer of Copyright Agreement (Elsevier, Taylor & Francis), License (ALA).  More importantly, it became impossible to limit the analysis to the CTAs since many of them reference other documents.  For example, Journal of Documentation references the Author's Charter.  Again, Figure 5 shows the presence of a separate self-archiving page.Many LIS journals do not have a CTA available on the Web. CTA analysis is a moving target; many journals changed policies even as we were carrying out the study, making data reported as recently as August 2005 no longer valid a few months later; for example, in November College & Research Libraries became an open access journal with a 6-month embargo period and permits the immediate self-archiving of preprints and postprints.Figure 4: Sample entry for an  ISI-ranked open access journalJournal URL:http://informationr.net/ir/Subject:Library and Information ScienceType:In ISI JCR, in ISI-SSCI, In DOAJPublisher:Lund University Libraries and University of Sheffield, Dept. of Information StudiesPublisher URL:http://www.lub.lu.se/new_top/omlub/bd_eng.htmlCTA URL:http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd-nc/1.0/Date:02/25/2005Last Update:11/09/2005Special Notes:"You are free: to copy, distribute, display, and perform the work Under the following conditions: Attribution.

Author can archive in open access archives. Author can archive pre-print and post-printNotes:Blackwell has a separate self-archiving page on its website which contradicts condition (b) above - http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/static/selfarchive.asp. According to it, 1) Authors are allowed to self-archive preprints and postprints in OAA but 2) postprints may have an embargo period depending on journal.  The CTA for ISJ mentions no embargo period.Our analysis of the ISI-ranked LIS journals shows that irrespective of the type of publisher (learned societies, university presses, or commercial), many do not make their self-archiving stance unambiguously visible. Annual Review of Information Science and Technology, Canadian Journal of Library and Information Science, Libraries & Culture, and Library Quarterly, are only a few of the professional society and university press journals that make no statement endorsing self-archiving, nor is a CTA publicly available for any of them. Journal of the American Society for Information Science & Technology (published by Wiley for ASIS&T) prohibits "systematic external distribution" but what exactly this means is called into question by the CTAs of other publishers.  On the other hand, commercially produced journals like Journal of Documentation (Emerald Publishing Group), Information Systems Journal (Blackwell), and Serials Review (Elsevier) appear to announce their self-archiving policies publicly  albeit ambiguously. Elsevier journals still don't make their CTA publicly available but Elsevier has a Copyright Policy document web document; Blackwell's Information Systems Journal, as we saw in Figure 5, has contradictory elements. Journals published by Emerald appear to prohibit self-archiving in open access archives at first glance of the CTA, but a reading of related documents like Emerald's Author's Charter reveals that self-archiving is permitted. Leadership from major professional associations in the US and Canada, such as the American Library Association, American Society for Information Science & Technology and Canadian Association for Information Science, has been slow. The Medical Library Association, on the other hand, signaled early and clearly; their journal went open in 2001/2002, and all back issues are openly available from 1911 onwards. The majority of LIS journals, we speculate, are not averse to self-archiving although LIS scholars, in general, don't appear to be aware of this, and how much LIS scholars-as-authors can self-archive in an OAI-compliant archive is still not crystal clear. Whether all LIS scholars hold the same definition of self-archiving as we do, how much they self-archive, and their strategies for locating content in open archives are questions the 2005 dLIST survey on self-archiving and scholarly communication in LIS sought to understand.The online survey of the scholarly communication behaviors of LIS scholars focused on self-archiving, and the instrument was adapted from Swan and Brown (2005).  The complete instrument, showing all the questions in the survey, has been self-archived in dLIST (Coleman, 2005), and we report only a few relevant, preliminary findings here.Two hundred forty-four usable responses were received.  Ninety-nine of the 244 respondents were faculty in LIS schools.  One hundred thirty-one defined self-archiving, but only 3 (n=131) corroborated ours by mentioning deposit in an OAI-compliant archive as their definition of self-archiving.  While 55.1% (70 of n=127) said they self-archive, only 17 (n=72) admitted they self-archive in dLIST.  Where do the rest self-archive? The majority, 27 (n=40), deposit their papers on their personal website, shared-network drive, or laptop, 9 self-archive in institutional repositories, 3 self-archive in E-LIS, and 1 self-archives in Social Science Research Network.  Twenty-four (n=55) were unaware of the possibility of providing open access through self-archiving. Reasons for not self-archiving ranged from lack of time, lack of acceptance ("most of the scholars cite paid articles from paid journals only"), lack of institutional support, and lack of integration with workflow tools like "Google", as well as concerns about copyright and peer review.  A few candidly admitted, "don't know how." Another wrote: "I feel guilty not using dLIST. Find a way to make it easier and I'll participate." Many revealed understanding and support of dLIST goals to connect LIS research, education and practice communities through a disciplinary service for all types of scholarly work:  "I like how any type of work can be archived...journal articles, teaching materials..."; "mention D-LIST as a self-archiving option, esp. for those with no institutional repository, very frequently."Eleven respondents use DL-Harvest to search for content in open access archives (n=106) and, not surprisingly, the majority, 84, used Google Scholar.  Finally, respondents had more questions than answers, as this quote from a single participant shows: "How can I do it? What is it? Where can I get it done? Will I have versioning control? Do I lose control of the article after I post it? How do I update as information changes? How do people who are using the archive know that something has been updated on an article they have read in the past? How can I create connections between my articles, or between my articles and other people's articles? What kind of visualizations and search interfaces are used to get people to my articles? How are they abstracted? Can I write my own dLIST specific abstract for display/browsing purposes? Who uses dLIST? Why would anyone bother? Am I wasting my time by putting my article there? How integrated with other services is dLIST? Is it indexed by Google and other search engines? If not, why not? Are there other ways I can access articles in dLIST without disrupting my workflow by going to dLIST's webpage or whatever interface exists? How does it work? How is an article's relevancy to a particular search evaluated? How are search results returned?"ConclusionClearly there is a great deal of work to be done  more educational or advocacy than technical  if federated OAI-compliant archives and services are to achieve the economies of scale that OCLC did for cataloging, or that stimulate the sort of innovations that ISI citation indexes enabled.  Despite comments such as "dLIST is a wonderful espace" and "DL-Harvest is a much needed subject service", the low rate of actual self-archiving raises the question of the value of dLIST and DL-Harvest. How much access to the closed literature are they providing, and what new forms of scholarship or innovation are they facilitating?.Besides sparking innovation and economies of scale subject aggregation and subsequent federation has the potential to bridge islands of disparities  in this case, the many research communities and their collections that can be gathered under an LIS umbrella. But how close to this are we? The preceding discussion has implicitly assumed that data and service providers have niche roles; data providers offer self-archiving in an OAI-compliant repository. They build communities and may experiment to offer simpler deposit and metadata interfaces, as well as facilitate bulk-imports to make self-archiving easier for users. Far-sighted data providers may also link to services such as DL-Harvest and improve their individual institutional repository visibility and accessibility. Translations, current awareness alerts, certification (peer review, trust), and reports of usage (downloading) and impact (citing services) may contribute to shared developments with service providers. Service providers may build yet more federated and customized services. However, this might not happen. Uncoordinated institutional repositories in LIS may inhibit collaborative development and scholarly use of non-commercial OA subject services; roles may become blurred. Scholars and professional associations in LIS should think strategically about the development of repositories and subject federated services, because doing so may also improve public perceptions and funding for the field (Armbruster, 2005).AcknowledgementsThanks to Richard Hill and Carol Tenopir for insightful comments on an early draft. Thanks, also, to everyone who completed the dLIST 2005 survey and especially those who self-archive in OAI repositories.  Attempts to build the LIS intellectual commons will be successful because of pioneers and innovators like you.  Funding for dLIST is from the University of Arizona (Tucson), Prop 301 initiative.Notes1 Other novel uses of OAI-PMH are described by Van de Sompel, Young and Hickey (2003).2 One of the Thomson-ISI ranked journals (http://scientific.thomson.com/, Journal of the Medical Library Association, became open access in 2001/2002 (Plutchak, 2005).  Back issues, 1911 on, are openly available through PubMed.3 This does not mean that all the different materials must be in the collection or even use the same repository software; we envisioned working with communities on an as-needed basis.4 As Kellog (2004) notes, the LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) is the chosen platform for some of the largest web services: Amazon, Paypal, Slashdot, and Google.5 <http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html#FlowControl>6 <http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html#ListSets>7 <http://dlist.sir.arizona.edu/downloads.html>8 DAEDALUS, a scholarly communication project at the University of Glasgow Library, <http://www.lib.gla.ac.uk/daedalus/> and Collib, a Master's LIS project in Norway, <http://collib.info/>.9 <http://dev.mysql.com/doc/internals/en/full-text-search.html>10 URL: <http://dlharvest.sir.arizona.edu/viewrecord.php?id=19732>11 URL: <http://dlharvest.sir.arizona.edu/archives.php?id=18> and URL: <http://dlharvest.sir.arizona.edu/archives.php?id=14>12 URL: <http://dlharvest.sir.arizona.edu/viewrecord.php?id=19102> and  URL: <http://dlharvest.sir.arizona.edu/viewrecord.php?id=18532>.13	Kristin Eschenfelder (University of Wisconsin at Madison) suggested the subject RSS  alerting service.14 <http://dLIST.sir.arizona.edu/cta>ReferencesAmerican Scientist Open Access Forum.

It is the first open access archive, established in 2002,exclusively for the Library and Information Science disciplines.   Scholars canself-register and deposit a range of materials in dLIST such asresearch articles, instructional units, bibliographies, datasets and survey instruments.  A strong editorial board comprisedof top-notch researchers and leading librarians approves the materials into the archive.  The innovative dLIST Classicsproject is digitizing fundamental texts - e.g., RanganathansFive Laws of Library Science.

In the sciences, there are many attempts to build the digital library of a discipline using ideas fromcommon pool resources theories for access and use management of the information resources.

I was able to subscribe in  my aggregator, now you can too!1 CommentPosted Sep 24, 2005 10:00 AM by Anita Coleman Great to see that ALA now has a blog. TechSource is so appropriate too.  Are you going to be adding a LIS faculty to your blog?  I ask because I've been blogging since mid-2002 and it's another way among many different ways for practicing professionals and LIS educators to collaborate.  I started blogging mostly because I hoped that if I shared my stream of consciousness it would help my students be less fearful/impatient of information science and technology - ASC Online - http://radio.weblogs.com/0109575/.  Last fall was when I had the most success with it (in terms of visible comments).  I also run another blog, the LIS Learning Showcase - for the students - based on Movable Type.  Here I hoped that students would be attracted to blogging as an easier way to build e-portfolios.  Alas, no takers on that yet - they still prefer me to do the uploads for now.  http://rani.sir.arizona.edu/~sirls/mt/.

I was able to subscribe in  my aggregator, now you can too!1 CommentPosted Sep 24, 2005 10:00 AM by Anita Coleman Great to see that ALA now has a blog. TechSource is so appropriate too.  Are you going to be adding a LIS faculty to your blog?  I ask because I've been blogging since mid-2002 and it's another way among many different ways for practicing professionals and LIS educators to collaborate.  I started blogging mostly because I hoped that if I shared my stream of consciousness it would help my students be less fearful/impatient of information science and technology - ASC Online - http://radio.weblogs.com/0109575/.  Last fall was when I had the most success with it (in terms of visible comments).  I also run another blog, the LIS Learning Showcase - for the students - based on Movable Type.  Here I hoped that students would be attracted to blogging as an easier way to build e-portfolios.  Alas, no takers on that yet - they still prefer me to do the uploads for now.  http://rani.sir.arizona.edu/~sirls/mt/.

D-Lib Magazine 8, no. 7/8 (July 2002-August 2002).Keywords: U.S.; Cataloging education after 2000Abstract: This article reviews the state of education in digital libraries and curriculum planning documents from professional associations in two areas: Library and Information Science; and Computing. It examines suggestions for integration and interdisciplinarity in education for digital libraries curricula using definitions of a discipline, interdisciplinarity, and the transdisciplinary structure of a university in order to discover how such integration may be successfully accomplished. A plan to use learning communities and develop an interdisciplinary curriculum for Knowledge Organization is briefly discussed.7. Fallis, Don and Fricke Martin. "Not by Library School Alone."

Cataloging & Classification Quarterly 23, no. 3/4 (1997): 75-83.Abstract: While the literature addresses to some degree the practitioner's view on the educational requirements of the entry-level cataloger, usually in the form of the theory vs. practice argument, little is written about specific qualities, skills, and abilities that the cataloging supervisor looks for when recruiting new catalogers. This article, written from a supervisor's perspective, outlines some of those specific attributes that we look for when recruiting and explains their importance in today's cataloging environment.10.

"Practitioner Perspectives on Cataloging Education for Entry-Level Academic Librarians." Library Resources & Technical Services 46, no. 1 (2001): 11-22.Abstract: The role of cataloging education within the library profession is a topic of considerable interest and debate. Fifty-five heads of reference and sixty-five heas of cataloging in Association of Research Librarians institutions responded to a survey based upon the Association of Library Collections and Technical Services Educational Policy Statement, Appendix: Knowledge and Skills, Intellectual Access and Informaiton Organization, concerning the importance of cataloging competencies for all entry-level academic librarians. The survey found that practitioners agreed upon a definite set of core cataloging competencies that all entry-level academic librarians should possess. This finding holds larger implications for library education for academic librarians and for the profession as a whole.15. MacLeod, Judy and Callahan Daren. "Educators and Practitioners Reply: An Assessment of Cataloging Education." Library Resources & Technical Services 39, no. 2 (1994): 153-65.Abstract: A recent study of entry-level catalogers indicated that they did not feel sufficiently prepared for their first professional positions by the courses they took in library school. This paper reporst the results of a survey of both cataloging educators andn practitioners. The survey was designed to gather the opinions of these professionals about cataloging course content, the chief objectives of cataloging education, cataloging practicums, what constitutes preparation for professional cataloging, theory vs. practice, on-the-job training, and the extent of communication between cataloging educators and practitioners. While recent discussions of the status of cataloging education have indicated that course content is becoming more generalized, the results of this study support the value of expanded graduate programs and advanced courses and practicums that utilize practitioners for instruction. The combination of narrative responses and quantitative data from the two groups provides an intriguing comparison of their assessment of contemporary cataloging educational objectives and goals.16. McAllister-Harper, Desretta. "An Analysis of Courses in Cataloging and Classification and Related Areas Offered in Sixteen Graduate Library Schools and Their Relationship to Present and Future Trends in Cataloging and Classification and to Cognitive Needs of Professional Academic Catalogers." Cataloging & Classification Quarterly 16, no. 3 (1993): 99-123.Abstract: This study examines what is taught in sixteen library schools in the United States. The trends and needs of Catalogilng and Classification professionals were analyzed from professional literature and compare with course descriptions. The author identifies the variety of ways that cataloging content is covered in education programs particularly the titles of courses containing cataloging content and also calls for curriculum experts to be aware of the quantitative and qualitative requirements of the profession.17. Morris, Dilys E. and Wool Gregory J. "Cataloging: Librarianship's Best Bargain." Library Journal 124, no. 11 (June 1999): 44-46.18. Powell, Ronald R. and Creth Sheila D. "Knowledge Bases and Library Education." College & Research Libraries 47, no. 1 (January 1986): 16-27.Abstract: A continuing topic of debate among library administrators and library educators is whether graduate library education adequately prepares librarians for the research library environment. Unfortunately, there has been little research to identify specific knowledge needs of academic research librarians or how these needs change over the librarians's career. There also has been insufficient attention paid to what training libarary administrators must provide to supplement the graduate programs as the librarian moves through a career that will span many years and countless changes. Therefore, randomly sampled ARL librarians were asked to rate fifty-six knowledge bases according to how important they were and the degree to which they possessed each knowledge.19. Riemer, John J. "A Practitioner's View of the Education of Catalogers." Cataloging & Classification Quarterly 16, no. 3 (1993): 39-48.Abstract: Future production of qualified first-time catalogers depends on the amount of cooperation between educator/practitioner. Collectively, both educator and practitioner must find common ground in education and preparation for the library student to be fully competent as a cataloger. The proposition of implementing laboratories, curriculum improvement for catalogers, and creation of internships gives the library student a mixture of theory and application, assuring proficiency as a first-time cataloger.20.

Ryans, Cynthia C. "Cataloging Administrators' Views on Cataloging Education." Library Resources & Technical Services 24, no. 4 (1978): 343-51.Abstract: One of the basic questions in structuring a cataloging and classification course in a graduate library school program is the importance of teaching course in the theoretical versus the practical mode or a combination of the two. This article reports the results of a survey of cataloging practitioners on their opinions on the following issues: (1)structure of the cataloging curriculum in today's graduate library school; (2) relationship of the use of computers in cataloging to the cataloging curriculum; and (3) adequacy of preparation of current graduates for positions as catalog librarians.22. Speller Jr, Benjamin F. "Putting Theory into Practice: An Overview of the Symposium." Cataloging & Classification Quarterly 16, no. 3 (1993): 1-6.Abstract: Together library schools and libraries can prepare entry level professional librarians for a smooth transition to the practical world of librarianship in technical services. The teaching of practice versus theory in librarianship remains an issue: this article is a commentary on how library schools are dealing with the problem.23. Spillane, Jody L. "Comparison of Required Introductory Cataloging Courses, 1986 to 1998." Library Resources & Technical Services 43, no. 4 (1999): 223-30.Abstract: Cataloging is an important part of library education. Concerns about the declining number of required introductory cataloging courses led to this study in which data collected from library school bulletins were compared to data gathered in a similar 1986 study. Results indicate that the number of required introductory cataloging courses has dropped.24. Tennant, Roy. "The Digital Librarian Shortage." Library Journal (March 2002).25. Urbanski, Verna.

"Cataloging Across the Curriculum: A Syndetic Structure for Teaching Cataloging." Cataloging & Classification Quarterly 24, no. 1/2 (1997): 35-59.Abstract: Continuous consideration of the curriculum and the environment is required to provide a cataloging curriculum responsive to an evolving profession yet grounded in solid theory and principles. The necessary competencies for future catalogers suggested by the cataloging community are examined. Fifty-two ALA-accredited library school programs are analyzed to determine the strength of cataloging within the curriculum and the degree to which the competencies are addressed. It is concluded that adequate education of future catalogers requires an expanded view beyond traditional cataloging courses. The recommendation is for a curricular syndetic structure that identifies relationships among courses and links courses with the concepts and competencies necessary for organizing information.27.

D-Lib Magazine 8, no. 7/8 (July 2002-August 2002).Keywords: U.S.; Cataloging education after 2000Abstract: This article reviews the state of education in digital libraries and curriculum planning documents from professional associations in two areas: Library and Information Science; and Computing. It examines suggestions for integration and interdisciplinarity in education for digital libraries curricula using definitions of a discipline, interdisciplinarity, and the transdisciplinary structure of a university in order to discover how such integration may be successfully accomplished. A plan to use learning communities and develop an interdisciplinary curriculum for Knowledge Organization is briefly discussed.7. Fallis, Don and Fricke Martin. "Not by Library School Alone."

Cataloging & Classification Quarterly 23, no. 3/4 (1997): 75-83.Abstract: While the literature addresses to some degree the practitioner's view on the educational requirements of the entry-level cataloger, usually in the form of the theory vs. practice argument, little is written about specific qualities, skills, and abilities that the cataloging supervisor looks for when recruiting new catalogers. This article, written from a supervisor's perspective, outlines some of those specific attributes that we look for when recruiting and explains their importance in today's cataloging environment.10.

"Practitioner Perspectives on Cataloging Education for Entry-Level Academic Librarians." Library Resources & Technical Services 46, no. 1 (2001): 11-22.Abstract: The role of cataloging education within the library profession is a topic of considerable interest and debate. Fifty-five heads of reference and sixty-five heas of cataloging in Association of Research Librarians institutions responded to a survey based upon the Association of Library Collections and Technical Services Educational Policy Statement, Appendix: Knowledge and Skills, Intellectual Access and Informaiton Organization, concerning the importance of cataloging competencies for all entry-level academic librarians. The survey found that practitioners agreed upon a definite set of core cataloging competencies that all entry-level academic librarians should possess. This finding holds larger implications for library education for academic librarians and for the profession as a whole.15. MacLeod, Judy and Callahan Daren. "Educators and Practitioners Reply: An Assessment of Cataloging Education." Library Resources & Technical Services 39, no. 2 (1994): 153-65.Abstract: A recent study of entry-level catalogers indicated that they did not feel sufficiently prepared for their first professional positions by the courses they took in library school. This paper reporst the results of a survey of both cataloging educators andn practitioners. The survey was designed to gather the opinions of these professionals about cataloging course content, the chief objectives of cataloging education, cataloging practicums, what constitutes preparation for professional cataloging, theory vs. practice, on-the-job training, and the extent of communication between cataloging educators and practitioners. While recent discussions of the status of cataloging education have indicated that course content is becoming more generalized, the results of this study support the value of expanded graduate programs and advanced courses and practicums that utilize practitioners for instruction. The combination of narrative responses and quantitative data from the two groups provides an intriguing comparison of their assessment of contemporary cataloging educational objectives and goals.16. McAllister-Harper, Desretta. "An Analysis of Courses in Cataloging and Classification and Related Areas Offered in Sixteen Graduate Library Schools and Their Relationship to Present and Future Trends in Cataloging and Classification and to Cognitive Needs of Professional Academic Catalogers." Cataloging & Classification Quarterly 16, no. 3 (1993): 99-123.Abstract: This study examines what is taught in sixteen library schools in the United States. The trends and needs of Catalogilng and Classification professionals were analyzed from professional literature and compare with course descriptions. The author identifies the variety of ways that cataloging content is covered in education programs particularly the titles of courses containing cataloging content and also calls for curriculum experts to be aware of the quantitative and qualitative requirements of the profession.17.

"Knowledge Bases and Library Education." College & Research Libraries 47, no. 1 (January 1986): 16-27.Abstract: A continuing topic of debate among library administrators and library educators is whether graduate library education adequately prepares librarians for the research library environment. Unfortunately, there has been little research to identify specific knowledge needs of academic research librarians or how these needs change over the librarians's career. There also has been insufficient attention paid to what training libarary administrators must provide to supplement the graduate programs as the librarian moves through a career that will span many years and countless changes. Therefore, randomly sampled ARL librarians were asked to rate fifty-six knowledge bases according to how important they were and the degree to which they possessed each knowledge.19. Riemer, John J. "A Practitioner's View of the Education of Catalogers." Cataloging & Classification Quarterly 16, no. 3 (1993): 39-48.Abstract: Future production of qualified first-time catalogers depends on the amount of cooperation between educator/practitioner. Collectively, both educator and practitioner must find common ground in education and preparation for the library student to be fully competent as a cataloger. The proposition of implementing laboratories, curriculum improvement for catalogers, and creation of internships gives the library student a mixture of theory and application, assuring proficiency as a first-time cataloger.20.

Ryans, Cynthia C. "Cataloging Administrators' Views on Cataloging Education." Library Resources & Technical Services 24, no. 4 (1978): 343-51.Abstract: One of the basic questions in structuring a cataloging and classification course in a graduate library school program is the importance of teaching course in the theoretical versus the practical mode or a combination of the two. This article reports the results of a survey of cataloging practitioners on their opinions on the following issues: (1)structure of the cataloging curriculum in today's graduate library school; (2) relationship of the use of computers in cataloging to the cataloging curriculum; and (3) adequacy of preparation of current graduates for positions as catalog librarians.22. Speller Jr, Benjamin F. "Putting Theory into Practice: An Overview of the Symposium."

The teaching of practice versus theory in librarianship remains an issue: this article is a commentary on how library schools are dealing with the problem.23. Spillane, Jody L. "Comparison of Required Introductory Cataloging Courses, 1986 to 1998." Library Resources & Technical Services 43, no. 4 (1999): 223-30.Abstract: Cataloging is an important part of library education. Concerns about the declining number of required introductory cataloging courses led to this study in which data collected from library school bulletins were compared to data gathered in a similar 1986 study. Results indicate that the number of required introductory cataloging courses has dropped.24. Tennant, Roy. "The Digital Librarian Shortage." Library Journal (March 2002).25. Urbanski, Verna.

"Cataloging Across the Curriculum: A Syndetic Structure for Teaching Cataloging." Cataloging & Classification Quarterly 24, no. 1/2 (1997): 35-59.Abstract: Continuous consideration of the curriculum and the environment is required to provide a cataloging curriculum responsive to an evolving profession yet grounded in solid theory and principles. The necessary competencies for future catalogers suggested by the cataloging community are examined. Fifty-two ALA-accredited library school programs are analyzed to determine the strength of cataloging within the curriculum and the degree to which the competencies are addressed. It is concluded that adequate education of future catalogers requires an expanded view beyond traditional cataloging courses. The recommendation is for a curricular syndetic structure that identifies relationships among courses and links courses with the concepts and competencies necessary for organizing information.27.

A Ministry of Prayer | Youth Interceding For America: Newz & ViewzNewz & ViewzDo you know what’s really happening in our nation? Here at Newz & Viewz, get the real takes on events, issues, and public affairs arising in our days and “Watch unto prayer!”Fact Sheet: Overview of the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act IntroductionThe Administration has released the names of 10 drug traffickers and entities against whom the President decided to impose sanctions pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (21 U.S.C. 1901-1908, 8 U.S.C. 1182). The Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (the "Kingpin Act") targets, on a worldwide basis, significant foreign narcotics traffickers, their organizations, and operatives. BackgroundThe purpose of the Kingpin Act is to deny significant foreign narcotics traffickers, their related businesses, and their operatives access to the U.S. financial system and all trade and transactions involving U.S. companies and individuals. The Kingpin Act authorizes the President to take these actions when he determines that a foreign narcotics trafficker presents a threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States. Congress modeled the Kingpin Act after the effective sanctions program that the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") administers against the Colombian drug cartels pursuant to Executive Order 12978 issued in October 1995 under authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act ("IEEPA"). ImplementationThe Kingpin Act requires that the Departments of Treasury, Justice, State, and Defense, and the Central Intelligence Agency, coordinate on the identification of proposed kingpins for designation by the President. Although not required by statute, the Department of Homeland Security also is included in the process. By June 1 each year, the Act calls for the President to report to specified congressional committees those "foreign persons [he] determines are appropriate for sanctions" and stating his intent to impose sanctions upon those foreign persons pursuant to the Act. While this is a recurring annual requirement, the President may designate significant foreign narcotics traffickers at any time. Under the Kingpin Act, the President may designate foreign entities as well as foreign individuals as kingpins. A foreign person is defined as "any citizen or national of a foreign state or any entity not organized under the laws of the United States, but does not include a foreign state." Likewise, the President is not required to designate Colombian persons exclusively under Executive Order 12978, issued in October 1995 under authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act ("IEEPA"), and may designate a Colombian individual or entity under the Kingpin Act, which is intended to be global in scope. The long-term effectiveness of the Kingpin Act is enhanced by the Department of the Treasury's authority (in consultation with appropriate government agencies and departments) to make derivative designations of foreign individuals and entities providing specified types of support or assistance to designated traffickers. This authority broadens the scope of application of the economic sanctions against designated kingpins to include their businesses and operatives. To date, the President has announced 48 Kingpins and the Department of the Treasury has announced a total of 66 derivative designations, 14 entities and 52 individuals, pursuant to section 805(b) of the Kingpin Act. These entities and individuals are subject to the same sanctions that apply to kingpins. In addition, designated individuals and immediate family members who have knowingly benefited from the designated individuals' illicit activity will be denied visas to the United States under 8 U.S.C. section 1182(a)(2)(C). The Kingpin Act provides for criminal penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment for individuals and up to a $10 million fine for entities for violations, as well as a maximum of 30 years imprisonment and/or a $5 million fine for officers, directors or agents of entities who knowingly participate in violations. The Kingpin Act also provides for civil penalties of up to $1 million. DesignationsThe foreign persons that the President has designated as appropriate for sanctions pursuant to the Kingpin Act are: Arellano Felix Organization (Mexico)Eduardo Ramon Arellano Felix (Mexico)Francisco Javier Arellano Felix (Mexico)Carrillo Fuentes Organization (Mexico)Armando Valencia Cornelio (Mexico)Norris Nembhard (Jamaica)Leebert Ramcharan (Jamaica)Fernando Melciades Zevallos Gonzales (Peru)Iqbal Mirchi (India)Haji Bashir Noorzai (Afghanistan) These names are being added to the designations first announced in June 2000 and announced every year since then.

Errol Chavez, DEA(AP) Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, Mexico's new No. 1 drug lord, rose to the top by eliminating rivals, winning over Colombian cocaine producers and evading a 19-month U.S.-Mexico effort to smash his smuggling syndicate, investigators told The Associated Press.Zambada is hardly a household name, yet he has become the most wanted drug smuggler in Mexico and is expected to be added soon to the FBI's Top 10 Most-Wanted Fugitives list, U.S. and Mexican drug agents told AP.Mexico's top anti-drug prosecutor, Jose Santiago Vasconcelos, called Zambada "drug dealer No. 1" and said the fugitive has become more powerful as his fellow kingpins have fallen, including one who was allegedly killed on Zambada's orders."With all the other groups, we have captured the leaders," Vasconcelos said at his heavily guarded Mexico City office. "He's the only leader we haven't caught."Zambada's organization was the target of "Operation Trifecta," a 19-month, U.S.-Mexican sting that ended July 31. Authorities say they collared 240 suspected drug smugglers in the United States and Mexico, seized nearly six tons of cocaine and unsealed U.S. federal indictments against Zambada, his son and his key cocaine distributor.Errol Chavez, head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's Arizona division, said the operation confirmed "the scope of (Zambada's) influence in Mexico is legendary," spanning nearly 30 years.Zambada, the 55-year-old leader of a drug gang based in the Pacific Coast resort city of Mazatlan, has formed alliances with "almost every known drug trafficking group in Mexico," Chavez said.No one knows exactly how much Mexico's drug trade - or Zambada's sizable share of it - are worth, but the White House estimates about half the $65 billion in narcotics that Americans buy each year comes through Mexico.Zambada has been charged with organized crime and drug trafficking in Mexico, and a U.S. indictment charges him with conspiring to smuggle cocaine.Zambada's rise to the top of Mexico's drug ranks began in February 2002, when police in Mazatlan shot and killed Ramon Arellano Felix. The feared enforcer for the Tijuana-based smuggling gang bearing his family's name, Arellano Felix had been on the list of the FBI's 10 most-wanted fugitives.Chavez and U.S. investigators in Mexico City who spoke on the condition of anonymity said Zambada lured Arellano Felix to his home turf and paid the police officers who killed him, although Mexican officials won't confirm that. Zambada has never been charged in the case.Zambada got another boost a month later, when authorities captured Ramon Arellano Felix's brother Benjamin, the Arellano Felix gang's operations chief.The Arellano Felix gang was Mexico's most powerful smuggling syndicate from the late 1990s until the death of Ramon Arellano Felix and the capture of Benjamin Arellano Felix.Many investigators on both sides of the border speculated that no one drug lord would step up and fill the power vacuum left by a weakened Arellano Felix gang.But Chavez said Zambada rose to power by winning the trust of Colombian cocaine producers in a way the Arellano Felix gang never could, allowing his organization to move more cocaine into the United States than most other smuggling syndicates."There were financial problems between the (Arellano Felix organization) and the Colombians," Chavez said, noting that as the Arellano Felix brothers fell, "bills went unpaid and the Colombians sought other trafficking organizations they trusted more.""They sought out El Mayo," he explained.Zambada formed close ties to a Colombian cocaine producing organization believed to be run by twin brothers Miguel and Victor Mejia Munera, U.S. investigators say.Arellano Felix syndicate smugglers still bring tons of cocaine into the United States via Tijuana. Rather than challenge the rival gang's authority between Baja California and California, Zambada has tightened his control of smuggling routes leading from neighboring Sonora state into Arizona, authorities say.Chavez said his office is stationing more DEA agents and informants in Sonora and southernmost Arizona in an effort to further target Zambada's group. The DEA also has received special funding for highway billboards between Tucson and Phoenix featuring a wanted poster of Zambada.Zambada remains a bitter enemy of the Arellano Felix gang, but is close to accused Juarez cartel leader Vicente Carrillo Fuentes and has reached out to Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, a convicted drug lord who escaped from prison and specializes in building drug tunnels under the U.S. border, authorities say."El Mayo is more of the businessman, the guy who wants to cooperate and bring people together," Chavez said. "He and El Chapo are very close. They have helped each other become very successful in Arizona."Originally from Sinaloa state where Mazatlan is located, Zambada got his start as an enforcer and hit man for the Juarez cartel based in the border city of the same name.Investigators can't agree on when he founded his own group of freelance smugglers. Mexico's attorney general's office still listed him as one of the heads of Juarez cartel's operations in Sinaloa as recently as 1998, but Chavez and other DEA officials said Zambada began working to form his own group in Mazatlan more than a decade ago.Mexico has taken out several top drug lords over the past two years. Besides the Arellano Felix brothers, police and soldiers collared Osiel Cardenas, the alleged head of the gulf cartel, in March. Last month, they caught up with Armando Valencia, one of thealleged heads of a drug gang based in the central state of Michoacan.Chavez said the DEA is watching family members Zambada has in the United States, but there's no evidence he has crossed the border.

Errol Chavez, DEA(AP) Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, Mexico's new No. 1 drug lord, rose to the top by eliminating rivals, winning over Colombian cocaine producers and evading a 19-month U.S.-Mexico effort to smash his smuggling syndicate, investigators told The Associated Press.Zambada is hardly a household name, yet he has become the most wanted drug smuggler in Mexico and is expected to be added soon to the FBI's Top 10 Most-Wanted Fugitives list, U.S. and Mexican drug agents told AP.Mexico's top anti-drug prosecutor, Jose Santiago Vasconcelos, called Zambada "drug dealer No. 1" and said the fugitive has become more powerful as his fellow kingpins have fallen, including one who was allegedly killed on Zambada's orders."With all the other groups, we have captured the leaders," Vasconcelos said at his heavily guarded Mexico City office. "He's the only leader we haven't caught."Zambada's organization was the target of "Operation Trifecta," a 19-month, U.S.-Mexican sting that ended July 31. Authorities say they collared 240 suspected drug smugglers in the United States and Mexico, seized nearly six tons of cocaine and unsealed U.S. federal indictments against Zambada, his son and his key cocaine distributor.Errol Chavez, head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's Arizona division, said the operation confirmed "the scope of (Zambada's) influence in Mexico is legendary," spanning nearly 30 years.Zambada, the 55-year-old leader of a drug gang based in the Pacific Coast resort city of Mazatlan, has formed alliances with "almost every known drug trafficking group in Mexico," Chavez said.No one knows exactly how much Mexico's drug trade - or Zambada's sizable share of it - are worth, but the White House estimates about half the $65 billion in narcotics that Americans buy each year comes through Mexico.Zambada has been charged with organized crime and drug trafficking in Mexico, and a U.S. indictment charges him with conspiring to smuggle cocaine.Zambada's rise to the top of Mexico's drug ranks began in February 2002, when police in Mazatlan shot and killed Ramon Arellano Felix. The feared enforcer for the Tijuana-based smuggling gang bearing his family's name, Arellano Felix had been on the list of the FBI's 10 most-wanted fugitives.Chavez and U.S. investigators in Mexico City who spoke on the condition of anonymity said Zambada lured Arellano Felix to his home turf and paid the police officers who killed him, although Mexican officials won't confirm that. Zambada has never been charged in the case.Zambada got another boost a month later, when authorities captured Ramon Arellano Felix's brother Benjamin, the Arellano Felix gang's operations chief.The Arellano Felix gang was Mexico's most powerful smuggling syndicate from the late 1990s until the death of Ramon Arellano Felix and the capture of Benjamin Arellano Felix.Many investigators on both sides of the border speculated that no one drug lord would step up and fill the power vacuum left by a weakened Arellano Felix gang.But Chavez said Zambada rose to power by winning the trust of Colombian cocaine producers in a way the Arellano Felix gang never could, allowing his organization to move more cocaine into the United States than most other smuggling syndicates."There were financial problems between the (Arellano Felix organization) and the Colombians," Chavez said, noting that as the Arellano Felix brothers fell, "bills went unpaid and the Colombians sought other trafficking organizations they trusted more.""They sought out El Mayo," he explained.Zambada formed close ties to a Colombian cocaine producing organization believed to be run by twin brothers Miguel and Victor Mejia Munera, U.S. investigators say.Arellano Felix syndicate smugglers still bring tons of cocaine into the United States via Tijuana.

DEA - Publications - Congressional Testimony - 03/21/00Statement by:Donnie R. MarshallActing AdministratorDrug Enforcement AdministrationUnited States Department of Justice Before the:Senate Drug Caucus on International Narcotics Control Date:March 21, 2000 Note: This document may not reflect changes made in actual delivery. Chairman Grassley, Members of the Senate. I appreciate this opportunityto appear before the Committee today to discuss the issue of Certificationand U.S. Counter narcotics efforts. I would like first to thank the Committeefor its continued support of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)and overall support of drug law enforcement. As all of you are aware, DEA is first and foremost a law enforcementagency. Although the certification process has proved to be an effectivediplomatic tool relative to the international antidrug effort, as a matterof policy, DEA does not make recommendations relative to certification.Each year, DEA provides the Attorney General with an objective assessmentof the drug trafficking situation for a country based upon evidence andfactual information. DEA's analysis of counter-narcotics efforts by anothercountry does not include an opinion on whether a country should or shouldnot be certified. We merely present the facts to U.S. policy makers andallow them to make an informed decision on the certification of a respectivecountry. As such, my comments today will be limited to an objective assessmentof the law enforcement issues involved with drug trafficking. As part of the submitted written testimony, I have also included thedrug trafficking assessment reports of several countries which were recentlyevaluated and either decertified or granted a waiver due to vital U.S.interests. These countries include Afghanistan, Burma, Cambodia, Paraguay,Nigeria, and Haiti. Due, however, to the magnitude of the threat drug traffickerspose to the national security of both countries, along with the strategicimportance to the United States, I will direct much of today's testimonyon Mexico. As many of you know, criminal organizations based in Mexico pose thegreatest challenge to U.S. law enforcement agencies charged with enforcingnarcotics laws. Due to the ever-increasing legitimate cross-border trafficand commerce between the U.S. and Mexico, several international organizedcrime groups have established elaborate smuggling infrastructures on bothsides of the U.S./Mexico border. Furthermore, it has long been establishedthat in addition to drug trafficking, these international criminal organizationsspawn violence, corruption, and intimidation that threaten the safety andstability of our cities and towns across America. The complex and sophisticated international drug trafficking groupsoperating out of Mexico are oftentimes vicious, destructive entities, thatoperate on a global scale. The largest drug trafficking organizations inMexico --- operating out of Guadalajara, Juarez, Mexicali, Tijuana, Sonora,and the Gulf region --- under the auspices of Vicente Carrillo-Fuentes,Armando Valencia-Cornelio, Miguel Caro-Quintero, Ramon and Benjamin Arellano-Felix,and Osiel Cardenas-Guillen are in many ways, the modern versions of themob leaders and groups that U.S. law enforcement has fought against sincethe beginning of last century. These international organized crime leaders,however, are far more dangerous, far more influential, and have a greaterimpact on our day-to-day lives than did their domestic predecessors. Those international traffickers and their organizations make operationaldecisions from places like Sonora, Mexico, and other locations outsideU.S. borders, which detrimentally affect the quality of life of our citizensand directly support drug-related crime in cities and towns across ourcountry. These groups have reached new levels of sophistication and havebecome a threat not only to the United States and Europe, but also to theirown countries. Their power and influence are unprecedented. Unless innovative,flexible, multi-faceted responses are crafted, these drug trafficking organizationsthreaten to grow even more powerful in the years to come. The Damage to the United States:In order to understand the extent and nature of the damage caused byinternational drug trafficking organizations, it is crucial to look athow these organizations work, and how they infiltrate and position themselvesin U.S. communities in order to further their goals. On any given day in the United States, business transactions are beingarranged between the major drug lords headquartered in Mexico and theirsurrogates who have established roots within the United States, for theshipment, storage, and distribution of tons of illicit drugs. In the past,Mexico-based criminal organizations limited their activities to the cultivationof marijuana and opium poppies for subsequent production of marijuana andheroin. The organizations were also relied upon by Colombian drug lordsto transport loads of cocaine into the United States, and to pass on thiscocaine to other organizations who distributed the product throughout theU.S. However, over the past several years, Mexico-based organized crimesyndicates have gained increasing control over many of the aspects of thecocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, and marijuana trades, resulting in increasedthreats to the well-being of American citizens as well as government institutionsand the citizens of their own country. In the recent past, traffickers from Mexico had maintained dominancein the western part of the United States, and in some Midwest cities. Today,the Drug Enforcement Administration, along with other law enforcement agencies,has developed evidence leading to indictments demonstrating that associatesof organized crime groups based in Mexico have established themselves onthe East Coast of the United States, thus becoming significant participantsin the nationwide drug trade. Mexican Traffickers Rise to Prominence:During 1995 and 1996, intense law enforcement pressure was focused onthe Cali leadership by the brave men and women of the Colombian NationalPolice. As a result, all of the top trafficking leaders from Cali wereeither jailed or killed. During that time frame, U.S. law enforcement agencieswere effectively attacking Colombian cells operating within the UnitedStates. With the Cali leaders imprisoned in Colombia and the successfulattacks by law enforcement on their U.S. cells, traffickers from Mexicotook on greater prominence. A growing alliance between the Colombian traffickersand the organizations from Mexico worked to benefit both sides. Traffickersfrom Mexico had long been involved in smuggling marijuana, heroin, andcocaine across the U.S.-Mexico border, using established distribution routesto deliver drugs throughout the United States. The Mexico-based organizations'emergence as major methamphetamine producers and traffickers also contributedto making them a major force in international drug trafficking. The Mexicantraffickers, who were previously paid in cash by the Colombian traffickersfor their services, began to routinely receive up to one-half of a shipmentof cocaine as their payment. This led to Mexican traffickers having accessto multi-ton quantities of cocaine and allowed them to expand their marketsand influence in the United States, thereby making them formidable cocainetraffickers in their own right. With the disruption of the Cali syndicate, Mexican groups such as theAmado Carrillo-Fuentes organization, the Arellano-Felix cartel, the Amezcua-Contrerasbrothers, and the Caro-Quintero group, consolidated their power and beganto dominate drug trafficking along the U.S.-Mexican border and in manyU.S. cities. Recent events in Mexico and along the southwest border emphasizethe fact that trafficking groups from Mexico have developed into a significantforce in international organized crime. Overview of Narcotics Smuggled along the U.S.-Mexican Border:Recent estimates indicate that approximately 55% of the cocaine availablein the United States is transported across the U.S.-Mexico border. Typically,large cocaine shipments are transported from Colombia, via commercial shipping,fishing and "go-fast" boats and off-loaded in Mexico. The cocaine is transportedthrough Mexico, usually by trucks, where it is warehoused in cities likeGuadalajara, Tijuana or Juarez, that are operating bases for the majorcriminal trafficking organizations. The extremely high volume of vehiculartraffic over the U.S./Mexico border allows cocaine loads to be driven acrossthe border and taken to major distribution centers within the U.S., suchas Los Angeles, New Jersey, Chicago, or Phoenix. Surrogates of the majordrug lords wait for instructions, often provided over sophisticated communicationsdevices--phones, faxes, pagers or computers--telling them where to warehousesmaller loads, who to contact for transportation services, and to whomto return the eventual profits. Individuals sent to the United States fromMexico, often illegally, have been shown to have contracted with U.S. truckingestablishments to move loads across the country. Once the loads arrivein an area that is close to the eventual terminal point, safehouses areestablished for workers who watch over the cocaine supplies and arrangefor it to be distributed by wholesale dealers within the vicinity. Thesedistributors have traditionally been Colombian nationals or individualsfrom the Dominican Republic, but recently, DEA has come upon evidence thatMexican trafficking organizations are also directly involved in cocainedistribution in New York City. We have not only identified the drug lords themselves, but in most cases,the key members of their command and control structure. The combined effortsof the DEA, FBI, DOJ, the U.S. Customs Service, and members of state andlocal police departments have resulted in the seizure of hundreds of tonsof drugs, hundreds of millions of dollars in drug proceeds, and most importantly,several significant indictments. In fact, some of the leaders of theseorganizations - Ramon and Benjamin Arellano-Felix, Luis and Jesus Amezcua-Contreras,Vicente Carrillo-Fuentes - have become familiar names in every major lawenforcement department in the United States. Despite this evidence, alongwith the notoriety, these traffickers have continued to evade arrest andprosecution. The primary reason they have been able to avoid arrest and continuetheir criminal enterprise is their ability to intimidate witnesses andassassinate and corrupt public officials. Clear examples of this pointmay be cited in recent efforts to apprehend members of the Arellano Felixcartel and the Cardenas Guillen cartel, based in Tijuana and Matamoros,Mexico, respectively. In Tijuana over the past year, Mexican officials,have not been able to apprehend key traffickers working for the ArellanoFelix organization. In November 1999, major Gulf cartel drug traffickerOsiel Cardenas Guillen illegally detained and assaulted two U.S. drug enforcementagents in Matamoros, Mexico, across the international border from Brownsville,Texas. Methamphetamine traffickers, oftentimes associated with major Mexicanorganized crime groups, obtain the precursor chemicals necessary for methamphetamineproduction from sources in other countries, such as China and India, aswell as from rogue chemical suppliers in the United States. In fact, Mexico-basedtransnational criminal organizations have become the most significant distributorsin the U.S. of methamphetamine and its precursor chemicals. Several bulkephedrine seizures destined for Mexico have focused attention on the magnitudeof ephedrine acquisition by Mexican organized crime groups. Methamphetaminesuper labs, capable of producing hundreds of pounds of methamphetamineon a weekly basis, are established in Mexico or in California, where themethamphetamine is provided to traffickers to distribute across the UnitedStates. Heroin from Mexico now represents 14% of the heroin seized in the UnitedStates by federal authorities, and it is estimated that 43 metric tonsof opium gum was produced in 1999 in Mexico. A recent study conducted bythe DEA indicates that as much as 29% of the heroin being used in the U.S.is being smuggled in by the Mexico-based organized crime syndicates. Mexicanblack tar heroin is produced in Mexico, and transported over the borderin cars and trucks. Like cocaine and methamphetamine, it is traffickedby associates of the organized criminal groups in Mexico, and providedto dealers and users in the Southwest, Northwest, and Midwest areas ofthe United States. At one time, it was commonplace for couriers to carrytwo pounds or so of heroin into the United States; recently, quantitiesof heroin seized from individuals have increased as is evidenced by largerseizures in a number of towns in Texas. This heroin is extremely potent,and its use has resulted in a significant number of deaths. Marijuana from Mexico still dominates the illicit U.S. import marketalthough U.S. experts estimate Mexico's marijuana production at 3,700 metrictons (compared with 4,600 in 1998 and 4,800 in 1997). In addition, during1999, the GOM eradicated some 23,547 hectares of marijuana (down from 24,200in 1998). Seizures of Mexican marijuana have increased from 102 metrictons in 1991 to 836.3 metric tons in 1999. Marijuana organizations fromMexico are very powerful and violent. In some places, traffickers fromMexico have established marijuana cultivation operations within the UnitedStates. In a recent case in Idaho, DEA , working with other Federal, state,and local law enforcement officials, arrested a group of illegal aliensfrom Zacatecas, Mexico. A total of 114,000 marijuana plants, weighing almost20 tons, was seized. This operation represented the largest marijuana seizureever in the state of Idaho. It is important to note that although many of the transactions relatingto the drug trade take place on U.S. soil, the major organized crime bossesdirect each and every detail of their multi-billion dollar business whilesituated in Mexico. They are responsible not only for the business decisionsbeing made, but also ultimately for the devastation that many Americancommunities have suffered as a result of the influx of cocaine, methamphetamine,heroin, and marijuana. These powerful and organized syndicates can frustratethe ability of the Mexican anti-drug police. Their ability to place obstaclessuch as corruption and unlimited resources in the path of police can oftentimesimpede investigations. In the past year, none of the major Mexican traffickingorganizations have been dismantled or significantly disrupted by Mexicanauthorities. Law Enforcement Response:Reporting indicates that the Southwest border (SWB) remains a majorpoint of entry for approximately 70% of all illicit drugs smuggled intoour country by Mexican trafficking groups. In response to this continuedthreat along the border, the DEA has established several initiatives thatfacilitate and improve intelligence and information sharing, while identifyingand removing impediments to cooperation. These initiatives employ a multi-prongedstrategy, which utilizes and combines law enforcement operations, intelligenceoperations, and provides for law enforcement assistance in order to achievesuccess in combating criminal drug trafficking organizations along theborder. The objective of these initiatives is to disrupt and ultimatelydismantle criminal organizations that smuggle illicit drugs into the U.S.by linking Federal, state and local investigations domestically and mobilizingmultilateral enforcement efforts abroad. Based upon past trends, intelligence,and recent seizures along the border, the DEA has established the followingpriorities for the SWB Field Divisions: (1) cocaine investigations involvingviolent organizations; (2) methamphetamine investigations, (3) heroin investigations,(4) marijuana investigations, (5) money laundering investigations and (6)diverted/dangerous drug and chemical investigations. Enforcement Operations/Strategies:In response to the emergence of these Mexican Drug Trafficking Organization's(MDTO), it became apparent that a coordinated strategy for law enforcementcounterdrug activities needed to be implemented. In order to combat drugproduction and trafficking networks operating along the U.S./Mexican border,DEA, in concert with other Federal agencies, established the SouthwestBorder Initiative - an integrated, coordinated law enforcement effort designedto attack the command and control structure of organized criminal operationsassociated with the Mexican Federation. This strategy focuses on intelligenceand enforcement efforts which target drug distribution systems within theU.S. and directs resources toward the disruption of those principal drugtrafficking organizations operating across the border. As such, DEA, in cooperation with other Federal, state, and local lawenforcement agencies is focusing increased intelligence, technical resources,and investigative expertise on the major MDTO's responsible for smugglingvast quantities of cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamine acrossthe border. Apart from this effort, DEA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation(FBI) also provide assistance in the form of operational planning, intelligence,and training to Government of Mexico (GOM) law enforcement authorities,to strengthen their capacity to combat these organizations. The SouthwestBorder strategy targets specific Mexican trafficking organizations operatingacross the border and attacks their command and control infrastructureswherever they operate. Further, the Special Operations Division (SOD) is a joint national coordinatingand support entity comprised of agents, analysts, and prosecutors fromDOJ, Customs, FBI, DEA and IRS. Its mission is to coordinate and supportregional and national criminal investigations and prosecutions againsttrafficking organizations that most threaten the U.S. SOD performs seamlesslyacross both investigative agency and district jurisdictional boundaries,providing field offices with necessary support, assistance, intelligenceanalysis and "leads" for investigative action. Within SOD, no distinctionis made among the participating investigative agencies. Where appropriate,state and local authorities are fully integrated into coordinated operations.As presently configured, SOD consists of five sections; each of which hasboth DEA, FBI, and USCS personnel assigned. One section targets ColombianTrafficking Organizations, a second concentrates on cocaine and herointrafficking in Europe and Asia, a third targets money laundering organizations,and the remaining two sections are the heart of the Southwest Border Projectand focus their efforts on the principal MDTO's. These two sections target,among other things, the command and control networks of the identifiedMDTO's, and their supporting organizations operating along the Southwestborder. As such, the interagency regional objectives are as follows; (1)Intelligence collection and analysis, (2) Investigations, (3) Interdictionand Enforcement and (4) Prosecution and Incarceration. The following operationdelineates the need and significance for such a multi-agency project: Operation Impunity:In September 1999, the DEA announced the conclusion of a two-year internationalinvestigation that culminated in the arrest of over 106 individuals linkedto the Amado Carrillo Fuentes (ACF) drug trafficking organization, headquarteredin Cancun, Mexico. This investigation, known as "Operation Impunity," wasa multi-jurisdictional, multi-agency investigation which directly linkeddrug trafficking activity in the United States to the highest level ofthe Mexican cocaine trade. This investigation began in January 1998 and was conducted jointly bythe DEA, FBI, USCS, U.S. Attorneys' Offices, DOJ/Criminal Division, anda host of state and local law enforcement agencies. The investigation encompassed53 DEA, FBI, and USCS case investigations which spans 14 Federal judicialdistricts. Since 1998, this investigation has resulted in 36 seizures,netting 12,434 kilograms of cocaine, a half a kilo of heroin, 4,806 poundsof marijuana, more than $19 million in U.S. currency, and the arrest of106 individuals. The above statistics only tell part of the story. Operation Impunitydemonstrated an unparalleled coordinated and cooperative effort among thelaw enforcement community. Overall, this investigation allowed the lawenforcement community to ascertain this organization's method of operationfrom the narcotic distribution in Colombia to the transportation throughMexico to the ultimate distribution networks throughout the U.S. Such successclearly demonstrates the need for the continuation of long term, multi-agencyinvestigations. Cooperative Efforts with the Government of Mexico/Status of VettedUnits:Subsequent to the arrest of General Gutierrez Rebollo in 1997 and theestablishment of mechanisms within the Mexican law enforcement infrastructure,such as the Bilateral Task Forces (BTFs) and the Vetted Unit program, DEAbecame cautiously optimistic relative to the prospects of the GOM's commitmentto bilateral investigations. The DEA has supported these programs financiallyand with other resources in hope that our efforts would result in a successfulattack against the drug lords who are creating so much havoc throughoutcommunities in the United States. However, continuing reports of corruptionand the rapidly growing power and influence of the major organized criminalgroups in Mexico cause us great concern about the long-term prospects forsuccess. Perhaps the arrest of Operation Impunity target Jaime AguilarGastelum and Operation Millennium target Guillermo Moreno-Rios, by Mexicanauthorities, is indicative of the GOM's future commitment to such jointventures. However, in the last year the Vetted Units Program in Mexico has notachieved the potential as originally envisioned by both governments. Inorder to address this issue, the DEA and the Government of Mexico's equivalentto the DEA, the Fiscalia Especializada Para la Atencion de Delitos Contrala Salud (FEADS), have agreed to carefully review the Program and establishways to improve its efficiency and effectiveness against mutually agreedinvestigative targets. The DEA also provides support and assistance tothe FEADS to conduct investigative endeavors throughout Mexico. These investigationsare being conducted with the primary investigative component of the FEADSvetted units - the Bilateral Task Forces (BTF's). Unfortunately, the investigative achievements by the BTF and the SensitiveInvestigations Unit (SIU) as related to cases against the major drug traffickingorganizations are minimal. The inability of these units to fully employthe new investigative techniques and authorities provided in the OrganizedCrime Law to investigate these major organizations has been equally disappointing.Further complicating investigative efforts, the Mexico City-based SIU wascompromised in February 1999 by a Mexican news exposé describingthe operations of that unit, to include its location, activities, and investigativetargets. Because of this setback, the SIU has been largely shut down. Inaddition, throughout 1999 police personnel from the Mexico City SIU wereseparated into smaller groups and often deployed to various regions throughoutMexico in order to work other investigations, such as the search for Mexicofugitive and former Governor of the State of Quintana Roo Mario Villanueva-Madrid. On a positive note, vetted unit personnel of the Organized Crime Unit(OCU), of which the SIU is a part, have been investigating a drug smugglingnetwork of the Carrillo-Fuentes organization in Cancun, headed by AlcidesRamon-Magana. During the course of this investigation, DEA has shared threeprincipal witnesses with the OCU who have provided information regardingthis organization . The information gleaned from these witnesses has contributedto the seizure of real estate in Quintana Roo and the arrest of severaldefendants in this case, including mid-level drug trafficker and money-laundererCarlos Colin-Padilla. In addition, the GOM issued arrest warrants for atotal of 44 individuals associated with Ramon-Magana including an arrestwarrant issued on April 5, 1999, against former Governor Villanueva Madridon 28 counts of drug related offenses. The governments of Mexico and the United States will continue to workcooperatively on investigations. Just this month, based upon informationprovided by the DEA to the GOM, two such operations were conducted, resultingin the seizure of a cocaine laboratory and a methamphetamine laboratoryin Mexico. Ultimately, DEA believes that the vetting process is our bestchance at ensuring integrity with our counterparts. As mentioned in previoustestimony today with respect to the ongoing bilateral Vetted Units Programsurvey, DEA will remain actively engaged with our GOM counterparts relativeto this process. DEA will also encourage the GOM to fully staff and supportthe BTFs and the SIUs with FEADS personnel that have already been vettedand to supply the resources that these operations require. Corruption Issues:Although the Mexican government is attempting to address the issue ofcorruption, it continues to be a serious problem in Mexican law enforcementinstitutions. The Federal Preventive Police (FPP) was created in early1999 in response to the existing corruption in the police ranks, but recentlyreported that several FPP agents were under investigation for corrupt activities.In December 1999 the Government of Mexico/PGR reported that between April1997 through 1999 more than 1,400 of the 3,500 federal police officershad been fired for corruption and that 357 of the officers had been prosecuted.Additionally, the National Public Safety System established a nationalpolice registry to prevent corrupt police officials from being rehiredby another law enforcement entity. However, the PGR has not fully implementedthese programs to deal with corruption. For example, in 1999, the formerDirector of Investigations for the PGR's SIU and OCU, Cuauhtemoc HerreraSuastegui, was reassigned to a high-level position within the PGR despitefailing polygraph examination in 1998. Although several FEADS vetted "floater"units have had several successes during 1999, the Vetted Unit Program failedto adhere to internal security principles involving the polygraph process,which may lead to potential compromises and corruption. The Mexican militaryalso has experienced narco-related corruption within its ranks. As of July 1999, an amendment to the Judicial Organic law mandated thatPGR officers, prosecutors, police agents, experts, and pilots assignedto narcotics eradication duties are required to undergo an evaluation process,to include background checks and polygraphs. Judicial efforts to stop corruption are also underway. On January 11,2000, a Mexican Federal judge issued an arrest warrant for the magistratewho wrongly freed Adan Amezcua-Contreras, a major methamphetamine trafficker. Perhaps the most alarming incident involving Mexican officials occurredon November 9, 1999, when a DEA Special Agent, along with a FBI SpecialAgent debriefed a Confidential Source in Matamoros, Mexico. During thecourse of this debriefing the Special Agents and Confidential Source weresurrounded and physically threatened by Mexican trafficker Osiel Cardenas-Guillenand approximately 15 associates. Each of these associates, one brandishinga gold-plated automatic assault weapon, were either municipal or statepolice officers. Furthermore, despite monitoring the entire incident overthe DEA Special Agent's cellular telephone, which had been used to callfor assistance, the Tamaulipas State Judicial Police Commander took noaction. Due in large part to their resourcefulness and ability to diffusethis dangerous situation, were the agents and the confidential source ableto survive unscathed. Among other issues, this incident highlights thevulnerability of DEA and FBI Special Agents working in Mexico. Status of Extraditions:The principal leaders of major drug trafficking organizations fear thethreat of extradition to the United States more than any other law enforcementor judicial tool. Extradition of significant traffickers ensures that thoseresponsible for the command and control of illicit activities, includingdrug smuggling and money laundering, will be held totally accountable fortheir actions and serve a prison sentence commensurate with their crimes. No major drug traffickers were extradited to the United States in 1999.The Mexican Government did extradite 10 fugitives on narcotics relatedor money laundering offenses in 1999 -- eight U.S. citizens and two Mexicancitizens. One Mexican citizen, a drug trafficker, was sought on drug chargesafter escaping from a U. S. prison while serving a sentence on drug relatedcrimes. The other Mexican citizen, who killed a United States Border Patrolagent, was sought on murder and marijuana smuggling charges. In September 1998, the Government of Mexico arrested U.S. Citizen andDEA fugitive Randall Jeffrey Spradling in Guadalajara which, given Spradling'sstrong ties to both Mexican and Colombian drug traffickers, was an importantevent. He is fighting extradition to the United States. In the past twelve months, some Mexican Courts have denied extraditionof significant drug traffickers, such as Jaime Ladino-Avila, to the U.S.due to a variety of reasons, such as a very dated legal precedent holdinglife imprisonment unconstitutional in Mexico. At the end of 1999, therewere approximately 40 persons in Mexican custody and subject to extraditionproceedings based on U.S. provisional arrest warrants and extradition requests. Conclusion: The Road Ahead:The United States' long experience with confronting and dismantlingorganized criminal activity has necessitated the development of an aggressive,cohesive, and coordinated strategy to identify, target, arrest, and incapacitatethe leadership of these organizations. DEA's role in addressing the drugproblem is to continue to attack the leadership of these internationalcriminal organizations. With a strategy consisting of mounting attackson the organizational command and control of major Mexican traffickingsyndicates that operate along the U.S./Mexico border, the DEA is able toattack the ability of these organizations to conduct business and impedetheir efforts to import drugs into the U.S. The effectiveness of national and bilateral efforts against drug organizationswill depend largely on demonstrable progress in disrupting and dismantlingthese transnational narco-trafficking organizations. This includes apprehending,prosecuting and convicting major drug traffickers, as well as exercisingextradition laws against those defendants facing federal drug traffickingcharges in the United States, and exposing and prosecuting individualsand businesses involved in providing critical support networks such asfront companies, security, transportation and the like.Therefore, it is imperative for law enforcement to continue to facilitatethe flow of information and intelligence while identifying and removingimpediments to cooperation. In this vein, it is vital for the DEA, alongwith other USG agencies, to continue to support the GOM in the field ofcounternarcotics operations. In turn, DEA encourages and expects the GOMto provide adequate investigative manpower, ongoing integrity testing,financial resources, equipment and reciprocal drug intelligence in supportof bilateral drug law enforcement, which should significantly improve bothgovernments' ability to counter and eliminate transnational drug traffickingorganizations. However, the true sign of success regarding anti-drug efforts in Mexicois best recognized with tangible results from concerted law enforcementefforts, i.e. the arrest and successful prosecution of significant leadersof these major drug cartels in Mexico and; where applicable, their extraditionto the United States to face federal drug trafficking charges. We are notyet there. Part II:As an addendum to the drug trafficking assessment on Mexico, includedare abbreviated drug situation reports on six countries. These countrieswere selected due to the Administration's recent announcement either decertifying(Afghanistan and Burma) or certifying due to vital U.S. interests ( Haiti,Paraguay, Cambodia, and Nigeria). These reports include criteria and guidelinesthat may be evaluated during the certification process. Paraguay:Paraguay's primary role in the cocaine trade is as a transit country.Traffickers send shipments of Bolivian cocaine HCl and base through Paraguayinto Brazil and Argentina for further shipment to the United States andEurope. Recent information also indicates that there is some traffickingof cocaine essential chemicals from Paraguay into Bolivia. Paraguayan cocaine traffickers serve primarily as facilitators for majorBolivian and Brazilian cocaine organizations. Paraguayan transportationgroups have, on occasion, provided aircraft and pilots to transportationgroups operating between Peru, Brazil, and Colombia. A common exchangemethod for Paraguayan traffickers is to trade luxury cars stolen in Asuncionand Argentina for Bolivian cocaine. This makes the capital for large cocainepurchases relatively easy to obtain and allows Bolivian traffickers tolaunder their profits directly into tangible assets. Counter-drug efforts in Paraguay are consolidated under the directionof the Secretariat Nacional Antidrogas (SENAD), a Federal agency with nationalauthority to propose legislation, conduct anti-drug education programs,control the diversion of chemicals and drugs, and to conduct drug investigationsand operations, including eradication efforts. In February 2000 RetiredArmy Colonel Hugo Ibarra was appointed as the director of SENAD. In spiteof continuing political turmoil within the government, Ibarra has displayedsome willingness to conduct investigations into drug trafficking and hascooperated with the DEA in mainly low level investigations. The Anti-Narcotics Directorate of the Paraguayan National Police (DINAR)is a full-time investigative unit consisting of approximately 100 policespecial agent personnel. DINAR is controlled organizationally and financiallyby SENAD. The DEA Asuncion Country Office (ACO) utilizes both organizationsto conduct investigations and operations. The formation of a DEA-sponsoredinvestigation/intelligence unit within the DINAR has enhanced the abilityof the ACO to conduct more sensitive investigations and to properly trainand equip this smaller and more secure unit. A criminal code promulgated in 1997 went into effect in November of1998. The new code provided sentencing guidelines for money launderingoffenses. Asset seizures are also provided for under Paraguayan law, butthe law is very new and has only been minimally used. In 1998, the Governmentof Paraguay signed an extradition treaty with the United States, whichincludes a provision for the extradition of nationals. The government alsodrafted legislation that explicitly authorizes undercover operations andcontrolled deliveries. Due to the political instability in Paraguay theproposed legislation remains pending. Burma:In 1999, Burma was named as the world's number two producer of opiumbehind Afghanistan. The 1999 CNC Opium Yield Survey, conducted jointlywith US and Burmese officials estimated the 1999 potential opium yieldto be 1,090 metric tons. This reflects a 38% decrease from 1998 surveyestimates of 1,750 metric tons. In February 2000, the CNC, Embassy andHost Nation officials conducted the 2000 Opium Yield Survey with the DEAas an accompanied observer. Burma continues to be a major producer of both heroin and methamphetamine.Burma accounts for approximately 80 percent of the total production ofSoutheast Asian opium. In 1999, the Government of Burma (GOB) seized 273kilograms of heroin, down from 490 kilograms in 1998. The decrease in seizuresis partly due to opium crop reduction, directly attributed to severe droughtconditions. Also attributed is the response by the GOB against narcotictraffickers, in response to intelligence information provided by DEA. Theincreased enforcement activity on behalf of the GOB has resulted in thetraffickers' utilization of smaller and highly mobile opium refineries. In 1999, the GOB seized in approximately 28.8 million tablets (approximately2,880 kilograms) of methamphetamine. During 1998, the GOB seized 16 milliontablets (approximately 1,600 kilograms). Additionally, in 1999, the GOBsseized 6.43 metric tons of ephedrine. The GOB continues to pursue additionalephedrine smuggling investigations. Methamphetamine produced in Burma is shipped almost exclusively to Thailand.The largest and most recent reported seizure in Thailand was 4.3 milliontablets (approx. 430 kilograms) on March 14, 2000. There have been sixreported seizures of Burmese produced methamphetamine, ranging from 200to 7,800 tablets among the Hmong and Mien communities residing in California. The United States Government policy towards Burma continues to linkpolitical change toward democracy and human rights issues with the narcoticsproblem. Currently minimal assistance is provided to Burma by the U.S.largely through assistance to law enforcement operations and to intelligencesharing by DEA with host government counterparts. Training, utilizing INLfunds, has been prohibited since 1989. The DEA Rangoon Country Office (RCO) has developed a working relationshipwith their Host Nation Counterparts (Directorate of Defense Services Intelligence/DDSI and State Peace and Development Council/SPDC). Intelligence indicates that corruption is rampant in Burma. This situationhas led to petty graft and corruption. However, the government has takenpositive steps to solve this problem by aggressively prosecuting and punishingviolators determined to be involved in corrupt practices. Cambodia:The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) enjoys a good relationshipwith the Cambodian National Police and the National Police Anti-Drug Unit.The Anti-Drug Unit is unable to carry out any type of sophisticated investigationdue to the lack of financial resources, extreme shortage of trained personneland lack of adequate investigative equipment. Cambodia is not a major producer of narcotics although large amountsof marijuana are cultivated with multi-ton quantities being exported toEurope. Marijuana production and trafficking is not considered to be amajor threat to the United States. In 1997, enforcement efforts resultedin the disruption and dismantling of a group of Americans identified tobe sending multi ton quantities of marijuana from Cambodia to the WestCoast of the U.S. The investigation resulted in the arrest of several ofits members and the seizure of approximately six tons of marijuana in Cambodiain June of that year. U.S. and Cambodian defendants were subsequently indictedin the U.S. Despite the fact that Cambodia has no extradition treaty withthe U.S., the Cambodian government deported the above defendants to theU.S. to stand trial. Through a cooperative effort, the Government of Cambodia(GOC) allowed DEA agents to interview the defendant's prior to their deportationto the U.S. In addition to the above, the GOC allowed two of their officersto travel to the U.S. and testify in a U.S. Federal Court. There is little hard intelligence or information available on herointrafficking involving Cambodia. There have been no significant heroin seizuresin the U.S. either transiting through or initiated from Cambodia. Corruption has been identified as an endemic problem in Cambodia, andhas adversely affected drug law enforcement. Poorly paid and ill-trainedpolice and judicial officials have been all-too-easy to look the otherway in narcotics and other criminal cases. Cambodia established a "National Authority for Combating Drugs" anda "Special Drug Enforcement Unit" in the Ministry of the Interior. Theappointed heads of these units currently do not have any law enforcementunits directly under their control, but do have the ability to call onresources from other enforcement agencies. The National Police remain DEA'sprimary contact. This year, the DEA's Office of International Training is scheduled toput on the Basic Investigators Training Seminar. The seminar will includeapproximately 60 National Police Officers. Nigeria:The Nigerian National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLA) has providedsome cooperation to DEA in those areas where it can. The most basic ofdrug law enforcement equipment is unavailable to the NDLEA. The NDLEA continuesto be underfunded, undertrained, and underpaid by the Government of Nigeria(GON), calling into question the GON's own will to attack and prosecutemajor drug traffickers operating in Nigeria. NDLEA officials continued to arrest low level couriers and growers.Major traffickers and organizations were largely unaffected. This is dueto the lack of training and modern equipment needed to identify, locate,monitor, and investigate the activities of the major drug traffickers operatingin Nigeria. Officials of the GON are quick to point to their yearly seizure statistics,which are slightly misleading. For example, in 1998 the NDLEA reports thatthey seized "over 10 tons of narcotics", which, taken at face value, appearsto be an impressive statistic. When urged to provide a breakdown of thedrug types seized, it is discovered that nine of those metric tons werecannabis, 503 kilograms were unspecified psychotropic drugs, 17 kilogramswere cocaine and only three kilograms, seized for the entire year, wereheroin. The bulk of the cannabis seizures are a result of an active plant eradicationprogram. The cannabis products are destined for local consumption and exportationto neighboring African countries, and some to various destinations in Europe.While it is a source of pride for the GON, the cannabis seizures have littleimpact on the United States. The NDLEA attempts to prosecute narcotics and money laundering violators,but are stymied by a dysfunctional judicial system and occasionally bygovernment corruption. Although there have been asset seizures in the past, a weakness in thelaw does not allow for asset forfeiture without a prior conviction of theowner of the asset. Since convictions are rare, no drug related forfeitureshave been reported. Afghanistan:The political situation in Afghanistan has adversely affected DEA'sstrategy and enforcement efforts. Due to security reasons, the Departmentof State has prohibited travel to Afghanistan for all of this year. UntilSpecial Agents can travel to Afghanistan, accurate reporting will be sporadicand unconfirmed. Currently, there are no ongoing counter narcotics programsor any cooperation in investigations underway between the U.S. and Afghanistan.Illegal drug production in Afghanistan, however, remains a major problemwhich must be addressed. Drug traffickers in Afghanistan are both the world's largest producersof illicit opium and major producers of cannabis products. In the absenceof a stable and universally recognized central government and the toleranceof poppy cultivation and conversion laboratories by the Taliban, cultivationof opium poppies is likely to increase in Afghanistan. According to the U.S. Government, 51,500 hectares of opium poppy werecultivated in 1999, versus 41,720 hectares in 1998, a 23% increase. Fromthis an estimated 1,670 metric tons of opium were produced, versus 1,350last year, a 24% increase. The increase results from favorable economicand environmental conditions, in particular high opium prices during theplanting season combined with ideal weather conditions during harvest. During 1999, representatives of the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, to includeDEA, have met several times with the Taliban High Commissioner for NarcoticsControl. In a recent meeting, the Taliban High Commissioner for Narcoticsstated that the Taliban government had taken measures to eliminate narcotics.He claimed that the government had recently seized 2,000 kilograms of opiumand heroin and had destroyed 34 laboratories. Other significant hauls havetaken place at various airports and border areas under Taliban control.A recent Taliban edict strongly admonished farmers to reduce poppy cultivationby one-third in the year 2000. A common complaint by the Taliban governmentis that the international community does not give the Taliban due creditfor these successes. The Taliban High Commissioner for Narcotics also deniedreports that the Taliban tax opium production. Afghanistan remains essentially a country divided into regions controlledby tribal leaders, all of whose support is necessary to effectively rulethe country. Afghanistan is not a center for money laundering and financialinstitutions barely exist. Due to the total destruction of the Afghan economy,narcotic traffickers often use proceeds to purchase goods abroad and smugglethese items into Afghanistan. Afghanistan continues to be a major recipient of multi-ton quantitiesof acetic anhydride, which is an essential chemical in the production ofheroin. Shipments of acetic anhydride arrive regularly for such purportedusage as leather tanning and machine cleaning. As there are no known legitimatebusinesses in Afghanistan utilizing acetic anhydride, these consignmentsare highly suspect. Chemicals used in heroin processing laboratories inAfghanistan usually are imported from India, Germany, and the former SovietUnion. Some progress has been made in the tracking of shipments from westerncountries. Several manufacturers have recently been cooperating and advisingDEA of suspect deliveries destined for Southwest Asia. Haiti:Haiti continues to be a transshipment and storage site for multi-hundredkilogram quantities of cocaine from South and Central America. The country'slong coastline, mountainous interior, numerous uncontrolled airstrips,and its 193-mile border with the Dominican Republic, as well as its locationin the Caribbean, make it an excellent transit site for drug shipmentsfrom Colombia destined for the United States. Colombian traffickers are the major players in the drug transportationbusiness in Haiti. As a result, Colombian organizations have become entrenchedin Haiti, and have cultivated long-standing relationships with Haitianand Dominican traffickers in order to facilitate their activities. Colombian traffickers, operating through Haitian contacts, transportmultihundred-kilogram quantities of cocaine through the southern coastof Haiti. Colombian traffickers are divided into two groups; those whohave lived in Haiti for some time and control drug operations and thosewho routinely travel to Haiti aboard commercial aircraft and vessels. The three primary methods for smuggling drugs into Haiti are noncommercialair methods, noncommercial maritime activities (primarily go-fast operationstransiting from Colombia to Haiti's Southern Claw) and containerized cargoon freighters or commercial/passenger aircraft. As drugs enter Haiti, theyare stored locally until they can be shipped to the United States or Europe.Drugs are smuggled out of Haiti via coastal freighters or containerizedshipping. The primary shipping routes are: Directly to the Miami River/South Florida area from one of several Haitianports such as Port-au-Prince, Miragoane, St. Marc, Gonaives, Cap Haitien,or Port de Paix. The drugs are typically secreted in hidden compartmentswithin coastal freighters. Transferred overland from Haiti to the Dominican Republic and then smuggledacross the Mona Passage into Puerto Rico via small vessels. Once in PuertoRico, the illicit drugs are then hidden in containerized cargo and shippedto the United States or Europe. Transferred overland from Haiti to the Dominican Republic and then smuggledinto the United States or Europe via containerized cargo. Jimani, Pederales,Malpaso, Dajabon, and Pepilo Salcedo are the border points that are mostfrequently crossed.Between May 1998 and January 2000, approximately 3,850 kilograms of cocainehas been seized off of 16 vessels coming into the Miami River from Haiti.In addition, on March 16, 1999, approximately 1.3 million dollars, whichhad been destined for Haiti, was seized on the Miami River off of the M/VLady Crystal. On January 31, 2000, an additional $1 million, which wasdestined for Haiti, was seized.#*#doctype html public "-//w3c//dtd html 4.0 transitional//en"#*#DEA - Publications - Congressional Testimony - 03/21/00Statement by:Donnie R. MarshallActing AdministratorDrug Enforcement AdministrationUnited States Department of Justice Before the:Senate Drug Caucus on International Narcotics Control Date:March 21, 2000 Note: This document may not reflect changes made in actual delivery. Chairman Grassley, Members of the Senate. I appreciate this opportunityto appear before the Committee today to discuss the issue of Certificationand U.S. Counter narcotics efforts. I would like first to thank the Committeefor its continued support of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)and overall support of drug law enforcement. As all of you are aware, DEA is first and foremost a law enforcementagency. Although the certification process has proved to be an effectivediplomatic tool relative to the international antidrug effort, as a matterof policy, DEA does not make recommendations relative to certification.Each year, DEA provides the Attorney General with an objective assessmentof the drug trafficking situation for a country based upon evidence andfactual information. DEA's analysis of counter-narcotics efforts by anothercountry does not include an opinion on whether a country should or shouldnot be certified. We merely present the facts to U.S. policy makers andallow them to make an informed decision on the certification of a respectivecountry. As such, my comments today will be limited to an objective assessmentof the law enforcement issues involved with drug trafficking. As part of the submitted written testimony, I have also included thedrug trafficking assessment reports of several countries which were recentlyevaluated and either decertified or granted a waiver due to vital U.S.interests. These countries include Afghanistan, Burma, Cambodia, Paraguay,Nigeria, and Haiti. Due, however, to the magnitude of the threat drug traffickerspose to the national security of both countries, along with the strategicimportance to the United States, I will direct much of today's testimonyon Mexico. As many of you know, criminal organizations based in Mexico pose thegreatest challenge to U.S. law enforcement agencies charged with enforcingnarcotics laws. Due to the ever-increasing legitimate cross-border trafficand commerce between the U.S. and Mexico, several international organizedcrime groups have established elaborate smuggling infrastructures on bothsides of the U.S./Mexico border. Furthermore, it has long been establishedthat in addition to drug trafficking, these international criminal organizationsspawn violence, corruption, and intimidation that threaten the safety andstability of our cities and towns across America. The complex and sophisticated international drug trafficking groupsoperating out of Mexico are oftentimes vicious, destructive entities, thatoperate on a global scale. The largest drug trafficking organizations inMexico --- operating out of Guadalajara, Juarez, Mexicali, Tijuana, Sonora,and the Gulf region --- under the auspices of Vicente Carrillo-Fuentes,Armando Valencia-Cornelio, Miguel Caro-Quintero, Ramon and Benjamin Arellano-Felix,and Osiel Cardenas-Guillen are in many ways, the modern versions of themob leaders and groups that U.S. law enforcement has fought against sincethe beginning of last century. These international organized crime leaders,however, are far more dangerous, far more influential, and have a greaterimpact on our day-to-day lives than did their domestic predecessors. Those international traffickers and their organizations make operationaldecisions from places like Sonora, Mexico, and other locations outsideU.S. borders, which detrimentally affect the quality of life of our citizensand directly support drug-related crime in cities and towns across ourcountry. These groups have reached new levels of sophistication and havebecome a threat not only to the United States and Europe, but also to theirown countries. Their power and influence are unprecedented. Unless innovative,flexible, multi-faceted responses are crafted, these drug trafficking organizationsthreaten to grow even more powerful in the years to come. The Damage to the United States:In order to understand the extent and nature of the damage caused byinternational drug trafficking organizations, it is crucial to look athow these organizations work, and how they infiltrate and position themselvesin U.S. communities in order to further their goals. On any given day in the United States, business transactions are beingarranged between the major drug lords headquartered in Mexico and theirsurrogates who have established roots within the United States, for theshipment, storage, and distribution of tons of illicit drugs. In the past,Mexico-based criminal organizations limited their activities to the cultivationof marijuana and opium poppies for subsequent production of marijuana andheroin. The organizations were also relied upon by Colombian drug lordsto transport loads of cocaine into the United States, and to pass on thiscocaine to other organizations who distributed the product throughout theU.S. However, over the past several years, Mexico-based organized crimesyndicates have gained increasing control over many of the aspects of thecocaine, methamphetamine, heroin, and marijuana trades, resulting in increasedthreats to the well-being of American citizens as well as government institutionsand the citizens of their own country. In the recent past, traffickers from Mexico had maintained dominancein the western part of the United States, and in some Midwest cities. Today,the Drug Enforcement Administration, along with other law enforcement agencies,has developed evidence leading to indictments demonstrating that associatesof organized crime groups based in Mexico have established themselves onthe East Coast of the United States, thus becoming significant participantsin the nationwide drug trade. Mexican Traffickers Rise to Prominence:During 1995 and 1996, intense law enforcement pressure was focused onthe Cali leadership by the brave men and women of the Colombian NationalPolice. As a result, all of the top trafficking leaders from Cali wereeither jailed or killed. During that time frame, U.S. law enforcement agencieswere effectively attacking Colombian cells operating within the UnitedStates. With the Cali leaders imprisoned in Colombia and the successfulattacks by law enforcement on their U.S. cells, traffickers from Mexicotook on greater prominence. A growing alliance between the Colombian traffickersand the organizations from Mexico worked to benefit both sides. Traffickersfrom Mexico had long been involved in smuggling marijuana, heroin, andcocaine across the U.S.-Mexico border, using established distribution routesto deliver drugs throughout the United States. The Mexico-based organizations'emergence as major methamphetamine producers and traffickers also contributedto making them a major force in international drug trafficking. The Mexicantraffickers, who were previously paid in cash by the Colombian traffickersfor their services, began to routinely receive up to one-half of a shipmentof cocaine as their payment. This led to Mexican traffickers having accessto multi-ton quantities of cocaine and allowed them to expand their marketsand influence in the United States, thereby making them formidable cocainetraffickers in their own right. With the disruption of the Cali syndicate, Mexican groups such as theAmado Carrillo-Fuentes organization, the Arellano-Felix cartel, the Amezcua-Contrerasbrothers, and the Caro-Quintero group, consolidated their power and beganto dominate drug trafficking along the U.S.-Mexican border and in manyU.S. cities. Recent events in Mexico and along the southwest border emphasizethe fact that trafficking groups from Mexico have developed into a significantforce in international organized crime. Overview of Narcotics Smuggled along the U.S.-Mexican Border:Recent estimates indicate that approximately 55% of the cocaine availablein the United States is transported across the U.S.-Mexico border. Typically,large cocaine shipments are transported from Colombia, via commercial shipping,fishing and "go-fast" boats and off-loaded in Mexico. The cocaine is transportedthrough Mexico, usually by trucks, where it is warehoused in cities likeGuadalajara, Tijuana or Juarez, that are operating bases for the majorcriminal trafficking organizations. The extremely high volume of vehiculartraffic over the U.S./Mexico border allows cocaine loads to be driven acrossthe border and taken to major distribution centers within the U.S., suchas Los Angeles, New Jersey, Chicago, or Phoenix. Surrogates of the majordrug lords wait for instructions, often provided over sophisticated communicationsdevices--phones, faxes, pagers or computers--telling them where to warehousesmaller loads, who to contact for transportation services, and to whomto return the eventual profits. Individuals sent to the United States fromMexico, often illegally, have been shown to have contracted with U.S. truckingestablishments to move loads across the country. Once the loads arrivein an area that is close to the eventual terminal point, safehouses areestablished for workers who watch over the cocaine supplies and arrangefor it to be distributed by wholesale dealers within the vicinity. Thesedistributors have traditionally been Colombian nationals or individualsfrom the Dominican Republic, but recently, DEA has come upon evidence thatMexican trafficking organizations are also directly involved in cocainedistribution in New York City. We have not only identified the drug lords themselves, but in most cases,the key members of their command and control structure. The combined effortsof the DEA, FBI, DOJ, the U.S. Customs Service, and members of state andlocal police departments have resulted in the seizure of hundreds of tonsof drugs, hundreds of millions of dollars in drug proceeds, and most importantly,several significant indictments. In fact, some of the leaders of theseorganizations - Ramon and Benjamin Arellano-Felix, Luis and Jesus Amezcua-Contreras,Vicente Carrillo-Fuentes - have become familiar names in every major lawenforcement department in the United States. Despite this evidence, alongwith the notoriety, these traffickers have continued to evade arrest andprosecution. The primary reason they have been able to avoid arrest and continuetheir criminal enterprise is their ability to intimidate witnesses andassassinate and corrupt public officials. Clear examples of this pointmay be cited in recent efforts to apprehend members of the Arellano Felixcartel and the Cardenas Guillen cartel, based in Tijuana and Matamoros,Mexico, respectively. In Tijuana over the past year, Mexican officials,have not been able to apprehend key traffickers working for the ArellanoFelix organization. In November 1999, major Gulf cartel drug traffickerOsiel Cardenas Guillen illegally detained and assaulted two U.S. drug enforcementagents in Matamoros, Mexico, across the international border from Brownsville,Texas. Methamphetamine traffickers, oftentimes associated with major Mexicanorganized crime groups, obtain the precursor chemicals necessary for methamphetamineproduction from sources in other countries, such as China and India, aswell as from rogue chemical suppliers in the United States. In fact, Mexico-basedtransnational criminal organizations have become the most significant distributorsin the U.S. of methamphetamine and its precursor chemicals. Several bulkephedrine seizures destined for Mexico have focused attention on the magnitudeof ephedrine acquisition by Mexican organized crime groups. Methamphetaminesuper labs, capable of producing hundreds of pounds of methamphetamineon a weekly basis, are established in Mexico or in California, where themethamphetamine is provided to traffickers to distribute across the UnitedStates. Heroin from Mexico now represents 14% of the heroin seized in the UnitedStates by federal authorities, and it is estimated that 43 metric tonsof opium gum was produced in 1999 in Mexico. A recent study conducted bythe DEA indicates that as much as 29% of the heroin being used in the U.S.is being smuggled in by the Mexico-based organized crime syndicates. Mexicanblack tar heroin is produced in Mexico, and transported over the borderin cars and trucks. Like cocaine and methamphetamine, it is traffickedby associates of the organized criminal groups in Mexico, and providedto dealers and users in the Southwest, Northwest, and Midwest areas ofthe United States. At one time, it was commonplace for couriers to carrytwo pounds or so of heroin into the United States; recently, quantitiesof heroin seized from individuals have increased as is evidenced by largerseizures in a number of towns in Texas. This heroin is extremely potent,and its use has resulted in a significant number of deaths. Marijuana from Mexico still dominates the illicit U.S. import marketalthough U.S. experts estimate Mexico's marijuana production at 3,700 metrictons (compared with 4,600 in 1998 and 4,800 in 1997). In addition, during1999, the GOM eradicated some 23,547 hectares of marijuana (down from 24,200in 1998). Seizures of Mexican marijuana have increased from 102 metrictons in 1991 to 836.3 metric tons in 1999. Marijuana organizations fromMexico are very powerful and violent. In some places, traffickers fromMexico have established marijuana cultivation operations within the UnitedStates. In a recent case in Idaho, DEA , working with other Federal, state,and local law enforcement officials, arrested a group of illegal aliensfrom Zacatecas, Mexico. A total of 114,000 marijuana plants, weighing almost20 tons, was seized. This operation represented the largest marijuana seizureever in the state of Idaho. It is important to note that although many of the transactions relatingto the drug trade take place on U.S. soil, the major organized crime bossesdirect each and every detail of their multi-billion dollar business whilesituated in Mexico. They are responsible not only for the business decisionsbeing made, but also ultimately for the devastation that many Americancommunities have suffered as a result of the influx of cocaine, methamphetamine,heroin, and marijuana. These powerful and organized syndicates can frustratethe ability of the Mexican anti-drug police. Their ability to place obstaclessuch as corruption and unlimited resources in the path of police can oftentimesimpede investigations. In the past year, none of the major Mexican traffickingorganizations have been dismantled or significantly disrupted by Mexicanauthorities. Law Enforcement Response:Reporting indicates that the Southwest border (SWB) remains a majorpoint of entry for approximately 70% of all illicit drugs smuggled intoour country by Mexican trafficking groups. In response to this continuedthreat along the border, the DEA has established several initiatives thatfacilitate and improve intelligence and information sharing, while identifyingand removing impediments to cooperation. These initiatives employ a multi-prongedstrategy, which utilizes and combines law enforcement operations, intelligenceoperations, and provides for law enforcement assistance in order to achievesuccess in combating criminal drug trafficking organizations along theborder. The objective of these initiatives is to disrupt and ultimatelydismantle criminal organizations that smuggle illicit drugs into the U.S.by linking Federal, state and local investigations domestically and mobilizingmultilateral enforcement efforts abroad. Based upon past trends, intelligence,and recent seizures along the border, the DEA has established the followingpriorities for the SWB Field Divisions: (1) cocaine investigations involvingviolent organizations; (2) methamphetamine investigations, (3) heroin investigations,(4) marijuana investigations, (5) money laundering investigations and (6)diverted/dangerous drug and chemical investigations. Enforcement Operations/Strategies:In response to the emergence of these Mexican Drug Trafficking Organization's(MDTO), it became apparent that a coordinated strategy for law enforcementcounterdrug activities needed to be implemented. In order to combat drugproduction and trafficking networks operating along the U.S./Mexican border,DEA, in concert with other Federal agencies, established the SouthwestBorder Initiative - an integrated, coordinated law enforcement effort designedto attack the command and control structure of organized criminal operationsassociated with the Mexican Federation. This strategy focuses on intelligenceand enforcement efforts which target drug distribution systems within theU.S. and directs resources toward the disruption of those principal drugtrafficking organizations operating across the border. As such, DEA, in cooperation with other Federal, state, and local lawenforcement agencies is focusing increased intelligence, technical resources,and investigative expertise on the major MDTO's responsible for smugglingvast quantities of cocaine, heroin, marijuana, and methamphetamine acrossthe border. Apart from this effort, DEA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation(FBI) also provide assistance in the form of operational planning, intelligence,and training to Government of Mexico (GOM) law enforcement authorities,to strengthen their capacity to combat these organizations. The SouthwestBorder strategy targets specific Mexican trafficking organizations operatingacross the border and attacks their command and control infrastructureswherever they operate. Further, the Special Operations Division (SOD) is a joint national coordinatingand support entity comprised of agents, analysts, and prosecutors fromDOJ, Customs, FBI, DEA and IRS. Its mission is to coordinate and supportregional and national criminal investigations and prosecutions againsttrafficking organizations that most threaten the U.S. SOD performs seamlesslyacross both investigative agency and district jurisdictional boundaries,providing field offices with necessary support, assistance, intelligenceanalysis and "leads" for investigative action. Within SOD, no distinctionis made among the participating investigative agencies. Where appropriate,state and local authorities are fully integrated into coordinated operations.As presently configured, SOD consists of five sections; each of which hasboth DEA, FBI, and USCS personnel assigned. One section targets ColombianTrafficking Organizations, a second concentrates on cocaine and herointrafficking in Europe and Asia, a third targets money laundering organizations,and the remaining two sections are the heart of the Southwest Border Projectand focus their efforts on the principal MDTO's. These two sections target,among other things, the command and control networks of the identifiedMDTO's, and their supporting organizations operating along the Southwestborder. As such, the interagency regional objectives are as follows; (1)Intelligence collection and analysis, (2) Investigations, (3) Interdictionand Enforcement and (4) Prosecution and Incarceration. The following operationdelineates the need and significance for such a multi-agency project: Operation Impunity:In September 1999, the DEA announced the conclusion of a two-year internationalinvestigation that culminated in the arrest of over 106 individuals linkedto the Amado Carrillo Fuentes (ACF) drug trafficking organization, headquarteredin Cancun, Mexico. This investigation, known as "Operation Impunity," wasa multi-jurisdictional, multi-agency investigation which directly linkeddrug trafficking activity in the United States to the highest level ofthe Mexican cocaine trade. This investigation began in January 1998 and was conducted jointly bythe DEA, FBI, USCS, U.S. Attorneys' Offices, DOJ/Criminal Division, anda host of state and local law enforcement agencies. The investigation encompassed53 DEA, FBI, and USCS case investigations which spans 14 Federal judicialdistricts. Since 1998, this investigation has resulted in 36 seizures,netting 12,434 kilograms of cocaine, a half a kilo of heroin, 4,806 poundsof marijuana, more than $19 million in U.S. currency, and the arrest of106 individuals. The above statistics only tell part of the story. Operation Impunitydemonstrated an unparalleled coordinated and cooperative effort among thelaw enforcement community. Overall, this investigation allowed the lawenforcement community to ascertain this organization's method of operationfrom the narcotic distribution in Colombia to the transportation throughMexico to the ultimate distribution networks throughout the U.S. Such successclearly demonstrates the need for the continuation of long term, multi-agencyinvestigations. Cooperative Efforts with the Government of Mexico/Status of VettedUnits:Subsequent to the arrest of General Gutierrez Rebollo in 1997 and theestablishment of mechanisms within the Mexican law enforcement infrastructure,such as the Bilateral Task Forces (BTFs) and the Vetted Unit program, DEAbecame cautiously optimistic relative to the prospects of the GOM's commitmentto bilateral investigations. The DEA has supported these programs financiallyand with other resources in hope that our efforts would result in a successfulattack against the drug lords who are creating so much havoc throughoutcommunities in the United States. However, continuing reports of corruptionand the rapidly growing power and influence of the major organized criminalgroups in Mexico cause us great concern about the long-term prospects forsuccess. Perhaps the arrest of Operation Impunity target Jaime AguilarGastelum and Operation Millennium target Guillermo Moreno-Rios, by Mexicanauthorities, is indicative of the GOM's future commitment to such jointventures. However, in the last year the Vetted Units Program in Mexico has notachieved the potential as originally envisioned by both governments. Inorder to address this issue, the DEA and the Government of Mexico's equivalentto the DEA, the Fiscalia Especializada Para la Atencion de Delitos Contrala Salud (FEADS), have agreed to carefully review the Program and establishways to improve its efficiency and effectiveness against mutually agreedinvestigative targets. The DEA also provides support and assistance tothe FEADS to conduct investigative endeavors throughout Mexico. These investigationsare being conducted with the primary investigative component of the FEADSvetted units - the Bilateral Task Forces (BTF's). Unfortunately, the investigative achievements by the BTF and the SensitiveInvestigations Unit (SIU) as related to cases against the major drug traffickingorganizations are minimal. The inability of these units to fully employthe new investigative techniques and authorities provided in the OrganizedCrime Law to investigate these major organizations has been equally disappointing.Further complicating investigative efforts, the Mexico City-based SIU wascompromised in February 1999 by a Mexican news exposé describingthe operations of that unit, to include its location, activities, and investigativetargets. Because of this setback, the SIU has been largely shut down. Inaddition, throughout 1999 police personnel from the Mexico City SIU wereseparated into smaller groups and often deployed to various regions throughoutMexico in order to work other investigations, such as the search for Mexicofugitive and former Governor of the State of Quintana Roo Mario Villanueva-Madrid. On a positive note, vetted unit personnel of the Organized Crime Unit(OCU), of which the SIU is a part, have been investigating a drug smugglingnetwork of the Carrillo-Fuentes organization in Cancun, headed by AlcidesRamon-Magana. During the course of this investigation, DEA has shared threeprincipal witnesses with the OCU who have provided information regardingthis organization . The information gleaned from these witnesses has contributedto the seizure of real estate in Quintana Roo and the arrest of severaldefendants in this case, including mid-level drug trafficker and money-laundererCarlos Colin-Padilla. In addition, the GOM issued arrest warrants for atotal of 44 individuals associated with Ramon-Magana including an arrestwarrant issued on April 5, 1999, against former Governor Villanueva Madridon 28 counts of drug related offenses. The governments of Mexico and the United States will continue to workcooperatively on investigations. Just this month, based upon informationprovided by the DEA to the GOM, two such operations were conducted, resultingin the seizure of a cocaine laboratory and a methamphetamine laboratoryin Mexico. Ultimately, DEA believes that the vetting process is our bestchance at ensuring integrity with our counterparts. As mentioned in previoustestimony today with respect to the ongoing bilateral Vetted Units Programsurvey, DEA will remain actively engaged with our GOM counterparts relativeto this process. DEA will also encourage the GOM to fully staff and supportthe BTFs and the SIUs with FEADS personnel that have already been vettedand to supply the resources that these operations require. Corruption Issues:Although the Mexican government is attempting to address the issue ofcorruption, it continues to be a serious problem in Mexican law enforcementinstitutions. The Federal Preventive Police (FPP) was created in early1999 in response to the existing corruption in the police ranks, but recentlyreported that several FPP agents were under investigation for corrupt activities.In December 1999 the Government of Mexico/PGR reported that between April1997 through 1999 more than 1,400 of the 3,500 federal police officershad been fired for corruption and that 357 of the officers had been prosecuted.Additionally, the National Public Safety System established a nationalpolice registry to prevent corrupt police officials from being rehiredby another law enforcement entity. However, the PGR has not fully implementedthese programs to deal with corruption. For example, in 1999, the formerDirector of Investigations for the PGR's SIU and OCU, Cuauhtemoc HerreraSuastegui, was reassigned to a high-level position within the PGR despitefailing polygraph examination in 1998. Although several FEADS vetted "floater"units have had several successes during 1999, the Vetted Unit Program failedto adhere to internal security principles involving the polygraph process,which may lead to potential compromises and corruption. The Mexican militaryalso has experienced narco-related corruption within its ranks. As of July 1999, an amendment to the Judicial Organic law mandated thatPGR officers, prosecutors, police agents, experts, and pilots assignedto narcotics eradication duties are required to undergo an evaluation process,to include background checks and polygraphs. Judicial efforts to stop corruption are also underway. On January 11,2000, a Mexican Federal judge issued an arrest warrant for the magistratewho wrongly freed Adan Amezcua-Contreras, a major methamphetamine trafficker. Perhaps the most alarming incident involving Mexican officials occurredon November 9, 1999, when a DEA Special Agent, along with a FBI SpecialAgent debriefed a Confidential Source in Matamoros, Mexico. During thecourse of this debriefing the Special Agents and Confidential Source weresurrounded and physically threatened by Mexican trafficker Osiel Cardenas-Guillenand approximately 15 associates. Each of these associates, one brandishinga gold-plated automatic assault weapon, were either municipal or statepolice officers. Furthermore, despite monitoring the entire incident overthe DEA Special Agent's cellular telephone, which had been used to callfor assistance, the Tamaulipas State Judicial Police Commander took noaction. Due in large part to their resourcefulness and ability to diffusethis dangerous situation, were the agents and the confidential source ableto survive unscathed. Among other issues, this incident highlights thevulnerability of DEA and FBI Special Agents working in Mexico. Status of Extraditions:The principal leaders of major drug trafficking organizations fear thethreat of extradition to the United States more than any other law enforcementor judicial tool. Extradition of significant traffickers ensures that thoseresponsible for the command and control of illicit activities, includingdrug smuggling and money laundering, will be held totally accountable fortheir actions and serve a prison sentence commensurate with their crimes. No major drug traffickers were extradited to the United States in 1999.The Mexican Government did extradite 10 fugitives on narcotics relatedor money laundering offenses in 1999 -- eight U.S. citizens and two Mexicancitizens. One Mexican citizen, a drug trafficker, was sought on drug chargesafter escaping from a U. S. prison while serving a sentence on drug relatedcrimes. The other Mexican citizen, who killed a United States Border Patrolagent, was sought on murder and marijuana smuggling charges. In September 1998, the Government of Mexico arrested U.S. Citizen andDEA fugitive Randall Jeffrey Spradling in Guadalajara which, given Spradling'sstrong ties to both Mexican and Colombian drug traffickers, was an importantevent. He is fighting extradition to the United States. In the past twelve months, some Mexican Courts have denied extraditionof significant drug traffickers, such as Jaime Ladino-Avila, to the U.S.due to a variety of reasons, such as a very dated legal precedent holdinglife imprisonment unconstitutional in Mexico. At the end of 1999, therewere approximately 40 persons in Mexican custody and subject to extraditionproceedings based on U.S. provisional arrest warrants and extradition requests. Conclusion: The Road Ahead:The United States' long experience with confronting and dismantlingorganized criminal activity has necessitated the development of an aggressive,cohesive, and coordinated strategy to identify, target, arrest, and incapacitatethe leadership of these organizations. DEA's role in addressing the drugproblem is to continue to attack the leadership of these internationalcriminal organizations. With a strategy consisting of mounting attackson the organizational command and control of major Mexican traffickingsyndicates that operate along the U.S./Mexico border, the DEA is able toattack the ability of these organizations to conduct business and impedetheir efforts to import drugs into the U.S. The effectiveness of national and bilateral efforts against drug organizationswill depend largely on demonstrable progress in disrupting and dismantlingthese transnational narco-trafficking organizations. This includes apprehending,prosecuting and convicting major drug traffickers, as well as exercisingextradition laws against those defendants facing federal drug traffickingcharges in the United States, and exposing and prosecuting individualsand businesses involved in providing critical support networks such asfront companies, security, transportation and the like.Therefore, it is imperative for law enforcement to continue to facilitatethe flow of information and intelligence while identifying and removingimpediments to cooperation. In this vein, it is vital for the DEA, alongwith other USG agencies, to continue to support the GOM in the field ofcounternarcotics operations. In turn, DEA encourages and expects the GOMto provide adequate investigative manpower, ongoing integrity testing,financial resources, equipment and reciprocal drug intelligence in supportof bilateral drug law enforcement, which should significantly improve bothgovernments' ability to counter and eliminate transnational drug traffickingorganizations. However, the true sign of success regarding anti-drug efforts in Mexicois best recognized with tangible results from concerted law enforcementefforts, i.e. the arrest and successful prosecution of significant leadersof these major drug cartels in Mexico and; where applicable, their extraditionto the United States to face federal drug trafficking charges. We are notyet there. Part II:As an addendum to the drug trafficking assessment on Mexico, includedare abbreviated drug situation reports on six countries. These countrieswere selected due to the Administration's recent announcement either decertifying(Afghanistan and Burma) or certifying due to vital U.S. interests ( Haiti,Paraguay, Cambodia, and Nigeria). These reports include criteria and guidelinesthat may be evaluated during the certification process. Paraguay:Paraguay's primary role in the cocaine trade is as a transit country.Traffickers send shipments of Bolivian cocaine HCl and base through Paraguayinto Brazil and Argentina for further shipment to the United States andEurope. Recent information also indicates that there is some traffickingof cocaine essential chemicals from Paraguay into Bolivia. Paraguayan cocaine traffickers serve primarily as facilitators for majorBolivian and Brazilian cocaine organizations. Paraguayan transportationgroups have, on occasion, provided aircraft and pilots to transportationgroups operating between Peru, Brazil, and Colombia. A common exchangemethod for Paraguayan traffickers is to trade luxury cars stolen in Asuncionand Argentina for Bolivian cocaine. This makes the capital for large cocainepurchases relatively easy to obtain and allows Bolivian traffickers tolaunder their profits directly into tangible assets. Counter-drug efforts in Paraguay are consolidated under the directionof the Secretariat Nacional Antidrogas (SENAD), a Federal agency with nationalauthority to propose legislation, conduct anti-drug education programs,control the diversion of chemicals and drugs, and to conduct drug investigationsand operations, including eradication efforts. In February 2000 RetiredArmy Colonel Hugo Ibarra was appointed as the director of SENAD. In spiteof continuing political turmoil within the government, Ibarra has displayedsome willingness to conduct investigations into drug trafficking and hascooperated with the DEA in mainly low level investigations. The Anti-Narcotics Directorate of the Paraguayan National Police (DINAR)is a full-time investigative unit consisting of approximately 100 policespecial agent personnel. DINAR is controlled organizationally and financiallyby SENAD. The DEA Asuncion Country Office (ACO) utilizes both organizationsto conduct investigations and operations. The formation of a DEA-sponsoredinvestigation/intelligence unit within the DINAR has enhanced the abilityof the ACO to conduct more sensitive investigations and to properly trainand equip this smaller and more secure unit. A criminal code promulgated in 1997 went into effect in November of1998. The new code provided sentencing guidelines for money launderingoffenses. Asset seizures are also provided for under Paraguayan law, butthe law is very new and has only been minimally used. In 1998, the Governmentof Paraguay signed an extradition treaty with the United States, whichincludes a provision for the extradition of nationals. The government alsodrafted legislation that explicitly authorizes undercover operations andcontrolled deliveries. Due to the political instability in Paraguay theproposed legislation remains pending. Burma:In 1999, Burma was named as the world's number two producer of opiumbehind Afghanistan. The 1999 CNC Opium Yield Survey, conducted jointlywith US and Burmese officials estimated the 1999 potential opium yieldto be 1,090 metric tons. This reflects a 38% decrease from 1998 surveyestimates of 1,750 metric tons. In February 2000, the CNC, Embassy andHost Nation officials conducted the 2000 Opium Yield Survey with the DEAas an accompanied observer. Burma continues to be a major producer of both heroin and methamphetamine.Burma accounts for approximately 80 percent of the total production ofSoutheast Asian opium. In 1999, the Government of Burma (GOB) seized 273kilograms of heroin, down from 490 kilograms in 1998. The decrease in seizuresis partly due to opium crop reduction, directly attributed to severe droughtconditions. Also attributed is the response by the GOB against narcotictraffickers, in response to intelligence information provided by DEA. Theincreased enforcement activity on behalf of the GOB has resulted in thetraffickers' utilization of smaller and highly mobile opium refineries. In 1999, the GOB seized in approximately 28.8 million tablets (approximately2,880 kilograms) of methamphetamine. During 1998, the GOB seized 16 milliontablets (approximately 1,600 kilograms). Additionally, in 1999, the GOBsseized 6.43 metric tons of ephedrine. The GOB continues to pursue additionalephedrine smuggling investigations. Methamphetamine produced in Burma is shipped almost exclusively to Thailand.The largest and most recent reported seizure in Thailand was 4.3 milliontablets (approx. 430 kilograms) on March 14, 2000. There have been sixreported seizures of Burmese produced methamphetamine, ranging from 200to 7,800 tablets among the Hmong and Mien communities residing in California. The United States Government policy towards Burma continues to linkpolitical change toward democracy and human rights issues with the narcoticsproblem. Currently minimal assistance is provided to Burma by the U.S.largely through assistance to law enforcement operations and to intelligencesharing by DEA with host government counterparts. Training, utilizing INLfunds, has been prohibited since 1989. The DEA Rangoon Country Office (RCO) has developed a working relationshipwith their Host Nation Counterparts (Directorate of Defense Services Intelligence/DDSI and State Peace and Development Council/SPDC). Intelligence indicates that corruption is rampant in Burma. This situationhas led to petty graft and corruption. However, the government has takenpositive steps to solve this problem by aggressively prosecuting and punishingviolators determined to be involved in corrupt practices. Cambodia:The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) enjoys a good relationshipwith the Cambodian National Police and the National Police Anti-Drug Unit.The Anti-Drug Unit is unable to carry out any type of sophisticated investigationdue to the lack of financial resources, extreme shortage of trained personneland lack of adequate investigative equipment. Cambodia is not a major producer of narcotics although large amountsof marijuana are cultivated with multi-ton quantities being exported toEurope. Marijuana production and trafficking is not considered to be amajor threat to the United States. In 1997, enforcement efforts resultedin the disruption and dismantling of a group of Americans identified tobe sending multi ton quantities of marijuana from Cambodia to the WestCoast of the U.S. The investigation resulted in the arrest of several ofits members and the seizure of approximately six tons of marijuana in Cambodiain June of that year. U.S. and Cambodian defendants were subsequently indictedin the U.S. Despite the fact that Cambodia has no extradition treaty withthe U.S., the Cambodian government deported the above defendants to theU.S. to stand trial. Through a cooperative effort, the Government of Cambodia(GOC) allowed DEA agents to interview the defendant's prior to their deportationto the U.S. In addition to the above, the GOC allowed two of their officersto travel to the U.S. and testify in a U.S. Federal Court. There is little hard intelligence or information available on herointrafficking involving Cambodia. There have been no significant heroin seizuresin the U.S. either transiting through or initiated from Cambodia. Corruption has been identified as an endemic problem in Cambodia, andhas adversely affected drug law enforcement. Poorly paid and ill-trainedpolice and judicial officials have been all-too-easy to look the otherway in narcotics and other criminal cases. Cambodia established a "National Authority for Combating Drugs" anda "Special Drug Enforcement Unit" in the Ministry of the Interior. Theappointed heads of these units currently do not have any law enforcementunits directly under their control, but do have the ability to call onresources from other enforcement agencies. The National Police remain DEA'sprimary contact. This year, the DEA's Office of International Training is scheduled toput on the Basic Investigators Training Seminar. The seminar will includeapproximately 60 National Police Officers. Nigeria:The Nigerian National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLA) has providedsome cooperation to DEA in those areas where it can. The most basic ofdrug law enforcement equipment is unavailable to the NDLEA. The NDLEA continuesto be underfunded, undertrained, and underpaid by the Government of Nigeria(GON), calling into question the GON's own will to attack and prosecutemajor drug traffickers operating in Nigeria. NDLEA officials continued to arrest low level couriers and growers.Major traffickers and organizations were largely unaffected. This is dueto the lack of training and modern equipment needed to identify, locate,monitor, and investigate the activities of the major drug traffickers operatingin Nigeria. Officials of the GON are quick to point to their yearly seizure statistics,which are slightly misleading. For example, in 1998 the NDLEA reports thatthey seized "over 10 tons of narcotics", which, taken at face value, appearsto be an impressive statistic. When urged to provide a breakdown of thedrug types seized, it is discovered that nine of those metric tons werecannabis, 503 kilograms were unspecified psychotropic drugs, 17 kilogramswere cocaine and only three kilograms, seized for the entire year, wereheroin. The bulk of the cannabis seizures are a result of an active plant eradicationprogram. The cannabis products are destined for local consumption and exportationto neighboring African countries, and some to various destinations in Europe.While it is a source of pride for the GON, the cannabis seizures have littleimpact on the United States. The NDLEA attempts to prosecute narcotics and money laundering violators,but are stymied by a dysfunctional judicial system and occasionally bygovernment corruption. Although there have been asset seizures in the past, a weakness in thelaw does not allow for asset forfeiture without a prior conviction of theowner of the asset. Since convictions are rare, no drug related forfeitureshave been reported. Afghanistan:The political situation in Afghanistan has adversely affected DEA'sstrategy and enforcement efforts. Due to security reasons, the Departmentof State has prohibited travel to Afghanistan for all of this year. UntilSpecial Agents can travel to Afghanistan, accurate reporting will be sporadicand unconfirmed. Currently, there are no ongoing counter narcotics programsor any cooperation in investigations underway between the U.S. and Afghanistan.Illegal drug production in Afghanistan, however, remains a major problemwhich must be addressed. Drug traffickers in Afghanistan are both the world's largest producersof illicit opium and major producers of cannabis products. In the absenceof a stable and universally recognized central government and the toleranceof poppy cultivation and conversion laboratories by the Taliban, cultivationof opium poppies is likely to increase in Afghanistan. According to the U.S. Government, 51,500 hectares of opium poppy werecultivated in 1999, versus 41,720 hectares in 1998, a 23% increase. Fromthis an estimated 1,670 metric tons of opium were produced, versus 1,350last year, a 24% increase. The increase results from favorable economicand environmental conditions, in particular high opium prices during theplanting season combined with ideal weather conditions during harvest. During 1999, representatives of the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, to includeDEA, have met several times with the Taliban High Commissioner for NarcoticsControl. In a recent meeting, the Taliban High Commissioner for Narcoticsstated that the Taliban government had taken measures to eliminate narcotics.He claimed that the government had recently seized 2,000 kilograms of opiumand heroin and had destroyed 34 laboratories. Other significant hauls havetaken place at various airports and border areas under Taliban control.A recent Taliban edict strongly admonished farmers to reduce poppy cultivationby one-third in the year 2000. A common complaint by the Taliban governmentis that the international community does not give the Taliban due creditfor these successes. The Taliban High Commissioner for Narcotics also deniedreports that the Taliban tax opium production. Afghanistan remains essentially a country divided into regions controlledby tribal leaders, all of whose support is necessary to effectively rulethe country. Afghanistan is not a center for money laundering and financialinstitutions barely exist. Due to the total destruction of the Afghan economy,narcotic traffickers often use proceeds to purchase goods abroad and smugglethese items into Afghanistan. Afghanistan continues to be a major recipient of multi-ton quantitiesof acetic anhydride, which is an essential chemical in the production ofheroin. Shipments of acetic anhydride arrive regularly for such purportedusage as leather tanning and machine cleaning. As there are no known legitimatebusinesses in Afghanistan utilizing acetic anhydride, these consignmentsare highly suspect. Chemicals used in heroin processing laboratories inAfghanistan usually are imported from India, Germany, and the former SovietUnion. Some progress has been made in the tracking of shipments from westerncountries. Several manufacturers have recently been cooperating and advisingDEA of suspect deliveries destined for Southwest Asia. Haiti:Haiti continues to be a transshipment and storage site for multi-hundredkilogram quantities of cocaine from South and Central America. The country'slong coastline, mountainous interior, numerous uncontrolled airstrips,and its 193-mile border with the Dominican Republic, as well as its locationin the Caribbean, make it an excellent transit site for drug shipmentsfrom Colombia destined for the United States. Colombian traffickers are the major players in the drug transportationbusiness in Haiti. As a result, Colombian organizations have become entrenchedin Haiti, and have cultivated long-standing relationships with Haitianand Dominican traffickers in order to facilitate their activities. Colombian traffickers, operating through Haitian contacts, transportmultihundred-kilogram quantities of cocaine through the southern coastof Haiti. Colombian traffickers are divided into two groups; those whohave lived in Haiti for some time and control drug operations and thosewho routinely travel to Haiti aboard commercial aircraft and vessels. The three primary methods for smuggling drugs into Haiti are noncommercialair methods, noncommercial maritime activities (primarily go-fast operationstransiting from Colombia to Haiti's Southern Claw) and containerized cargoon freighters or commercial/passenger aircraft. As drugs enter Haiti, theyare stored locally until they can be shipped to the United States or Europe.Drugs are smuggled out of Haiti via coastal freighters or containerizedshipping. The primary shipping routes are: Directly to the Miami River/South Florida area from one of several Haitianports such as Port-au-Prince, Miragoane, St. Marc, Gonaives, Cap Haitien,or Port de Paix. The drugs are typically secreted in hidden compartmentswithin coastal freighters. Transferred overland from Haiti to the Dominican Republic and then smuggledacross the Mona Passage into Puerto Rico via small vessels. Once in PuertoRico, the illicit drugs are then hidden in containerized cargo and shippedto the United States or Europe. Transferred overland from Haiti to the Dominican Republic and then smuggledinto the United States or Europe via containerized cargo. Jimani, Pederales,Malpaso, Dajabon, and Pepilo Salcedo are the border points that are mostfrequently crossed.Between May 1998 and January 2000, approximately 3,850 kilograms of cocainehas been seized off of 16 vessels coming into the Miami River from Haiti.In addition, on March 16, 1999, approximately 1.3 million dollars, whichhad been destined for Haiti, was seized on the Miami River off of the M/VLady Crystal. On January 31, 2000, an additional $1 million, which wasdestined for Haiti, was seized.#*#

The Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court on Tuesday completed the appeal case of Yu Huafeng (喻華峰), the former vice chief editor of the paper, reducing his sentence for corruption to eight years from 12. Li Minying (李民英), the former deputy Communist Party head of the paper, had his sentence reduced from 11 years to six years. The two were jailed on corruption charges linked to the routine distribution of bonuses at the paper.■ Hong KongMass arrests in brothelsOfficers have arrested 107 people in three days of raids on brothels suspected to have ties to Chinese crime gangs, police said yesterday. The raids occurred in Mongkok, a popular tourist area notorious for prostitution, police spokeswoman Kelly Chan said. Five men, aged 33 to 50, were charged with conspiracy to manage a vice establishment. A 33-year-old man was charged with conspiracy to traffic women to Hong Kong for prostitution, a police statement said. Thirty-three women from China, aged 15 to 45, were charged with violating their visitor visas. The remaining 68 suspects were still being detained for questioning, Chan said.■ AustraliaInsanity for shooterAn honors student who went on a shooting spree that killed two people and wounded five at an Australian university was declared innocent Thursday of murder and attempted murder on the grounds of insanity. The shooting spree at Monash University in Melbourne in 2002 shocked this nation, where violence at schools and university campuses are rare. Despite clearing 38-year-old Huan Xiang of two counts of murder and five of attempted murder, Victorian Supreme Court judge justice Bernard Teague ordered that he be detained in a secure psychiatric institution for 25 years.■ VietnamCross-border bus on trackVietnam and Thailand have cleared a snag over which side of a bus should have the steering wheel and reached a tentative agreement on launching a cross-border tourist bus service, a Vietnamese tourism official said yesterday. Progress on the bus service held up because of Vietnam's ban on vehicles with steering wheels on the right-hand side  --  standard for vehicles from Thailand, where they are driven on the left side of the street. Vietnam, where cars are driven on the right, has now agreed to allow the Thai buses to operate in the communist country.■ AntarcticaJapanese garbage clearedJapanese researchers in Antarctica are getting serious about cleaning up the half-century's worth of garbage piled up at their base on the southernmost continent, an official said yesterday. Building materials, cast-off snow vehicles and fuel drums have collected at the research base since the first expedition was launched in 1956. By 1998, the garbage weighed about 500 tonnes and research teams began chipping away at the pile to clear it. Now, those efforts are being accelerated in an international effort to clean up Antarctica. Japan's Science Ministry hopes to send the remaining 337 tonnes of garbage home within four years, a ministry official said.■ SwitzerlandBanks release war recordsSwiss banks have agreed to release records of thousands of World War II-era accounts that may belong to victims of the Nazis. A lawyer for Nazi victims who sued the banks said the agreement could allow the victims or their descendants to obtain hundreds of millions of dollars in unclaimed funds. If Swiss authorities approve the agreement, Credit Suisse and UBS AG will publish the names of 3,000 accounts opened during the Nazi era. They will open databases of Nazi-era accounts for comparison with a list of thousands hoping to recover family assets from Swiss banks.■ MexicoBounty on prosecutor's headThree major drug cartels in Mexico are offering rewards of more than US$2 million to assassinate Mexican Attorney General Rafael Macedo de la Concha, press reports said Wednesday. Deputy Attorney General Jose Luis Santiago Vasconcelos told reporters that death threats to Macedo and to himself have been received from the Gulf cartel, led by Osiel Cardenas, who is in prison; from the Tijuana cartel, which is run by the Arellano Felix brothers; and from the so-called Millennium cartel, headed by drug lord Armando Valencia.■ United StatesChickens get justiceSeven Georgia teenagers who beheaded two chickens because they were curious whether they would run around with their heads cut off will soon learn a lot more about the birds. A judge ordered the five boys and two girls  --  ages 17 to 19  --  to clean chicken coops and read a book about animal cruelty as part of their sentence. Last September the seven teens bought machetes, kitchen knives and a hatchet, then drove to a farm and stole eight chickens. They beheaded two of them, videotaping the carnage before the homeowner caught them. The chickens "sort of ran a very short distance and they sort of flopped over," defense attorney Garland Moore said.■ United StatesEl Paso sweatiest US cityEl Paso, Texas, with average summer temperatures above 34?C and relative humidity over 70 percent, is the sweatiest city in the US, according to a study released on Tuesday. Research scientist Tim Long calculated heat indexes and relative humidity levels to come up with his top 100 sweatiest cities in the US list. By Long's calculations, in just four hours, El Paso's residents produce enough sweat to fill an Olympic swimming pool, with individuals shedding more than 1 liter of perspiration an hour. "The driving force is heat, but humidity is a key factor," Long said.■ United KingdomMonogamy gene foundA single gene inserted into the brain can change promiscuous male rodents into faithful, monogamous partners, scientists said on Wednesday. It may not be quite that simple to rein in human philanderers  --  many genes as well as other factors are probably involved in relationships among people. But researchers at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center of Emory University and Atlanta's Center for Behavioral Neuroscience (CBN) in the US said their results could help to explain the neurobiology of romantic love. The study suggests that "changes in the activity of a single gene profoundly can change a fundamental social behavior of animals within a species," said Larry Young, a researcher at the university.■ RussiaUS, Russia work togetherA Russian Proton-M booster rocket blasted into space early yesterday, carrying a US satellite, Russian space officials said. The rocket was launched from Russia's Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on schedule at 2:27am Moscow time, said Alexander Bobrinyov of the Khrunichev space company.The Intelsat-10 satellite, when in orbit around the Earth, will be used to provide live television broadcasting, telephone communications and Internet connections to Intelsat's customers in South America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.■ United StatesCow manure pollutesAir quality regulators are proposing what they say would be the first attempt in America to regulate smog-forming emissions from cow manure. Cows in southern California dairies, especially around the farm community of Chino, produce 1 million tonnes of manure every year, according to the South Coast Air Quality Management District, which is proposing the new rules. As it decomposes, the manure releases more than 20 tonnes of pollutants daily  --  mostly ammonia  --  and combines with pollution blown downwind from Los Angeles and Orange counties, aggravating Southern California's worst-in-the-nation smog problem.■ PortugalIrishman steals ambulanceAn Irish man was to appear in court in southern Portugal on Wednesday after he stole an ambulance and briefly drove it while   drunk, police said. Paramedics left their keys in the ignition of the ambulance while they attended to a patient in a house in Portimao, 250km south of Lisbon, police spokesman Alexandre Coimbra said. The Irish man then made off with the ambulance but was stopped by police after having driven just 200m, he added. No one was hurt in the incident. The man was found to have 2.8 grams of alcohol per liter in his blood, far in excess of the national drink-drive limit of 0.5 grams. He was charged with automobile theft and drink driving, Coimbra said.■ ZimbabweMugabe admits HIV in familyThe Zimbabwean president, Robert Mugabe, admitted for the first time on Wednesday that members of his family had been affected by HIV/Aids. Mugabe told a conference on Aids that unnamed members of his family had become ill from the disease. Describing HIV/Aids as "one of the greatest challenges facing our nation," he said that most people had been affected "and that includes the extended family of the president himself." The admission came after years of official neglect of a virus that has infected almost a quarter of adults in Zimbabwe, one of the highest prevalence rates in the world. Last year, 1.8 million Zimbabweans were infected and a recent survey found that 51 percent of prisoners were HIV-positive.■ CongoRefugees escape to BurundiMore than 22,000 refugees have fled into neighboring Burundi to escape heightened tensions in eastern Congo, officials said, after weeks of strife between loyalists and former rebels that have rattled the peace process in Africa's third-largest nation.

The Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court on Tuesday completed the appeal case of Yu Huafeng (喻華峰), the former vice chief editor of the paper, reducing his sentence for corruption to eight years from 12. Li Minying (李民英), the former deputy Communist Party head of the paper, had his sentence reduced from 11 years to six years. The two were jailed on corruption charges linked to the routine distribution of bonuses at the paper.■ Hong KongMass arrests in brothelsOfficers have arrested 107 people in three days of raids on brothels suspected to have ties to Chinese crime gangs, police said yesterday. The raids occurred in Mongkok, a popular tourist area notorious for prostitution, police spokeswoman Kelly Chan said. Five men, aged 33 to 50, were charged with conspiracy to manage a vice establishment. A 33-year-old man was charged with conspiracy to traffic women to Hong Kong for prostitution, a police statement said. Thirty-three women from China, aged 15 to 45, were charged with violating their visitor visas. The remaining 68 suspects were still being detained for questioning, Chan said.■ AustraliaInsanity for shooterAn honors student who went on a shooting spree that killed two people and wounded five at an Australian university was declared innocent Thursday of murder and attempted murder on the grounds of insanity. The shooting spree at Monash University in Melbourne in 2002 shocked this nation, where violence at schools and university campuses are rare. Despite clearing 38-year-old Huan Xiang of two counts of murder and five of attempted murder, Victorian Supreme Court judge justice Bernard Teague ordered that he be detained in a secure psychiatric institution for 25 years.■ VietnamCross-border bus on trackVietnam and Thailand have cleared a snag over which side of a bus should have the steering wheel and reached a tentative agreement on launching a cross-border tourist bus service, a Vietnamese tourism official said yesterday. Progress on the bus service held up because of Vietnam's ban on vehicles with steering wheels on the right-hand side  --  standard for vehicles from Thailand, where they are driven on the left side of the street. Vietnam, where cars are driven on the right, has now agreed to allow the Thai buses to operate in the communist country.■ AntarcticaJapanese garbage clearedJapanese researchers in Antarctica are getting serious about cleaning up the half-century's worth of garbage piled up at their base on the southernmost continent, an official said yesterday. Building materials, cast-off snow vehicles and fuel drums have collected at the research base since the first expedition was launched in 1956. By 1998, the garbage weighed about 500 tonnes and research teams began chipping away at the pile to clear it. Now, those efforts are being accelerated in an international effort to clean up Antarctica. Japan's Science Ministry hopes to send the remaining 337 tonnes of garbage home within four years, a ministry official said.■ SwitzerlandBanks release war recordsSwiss banks have agreed to release records of thousands of World War II-era accounts that may belong to victims of the Nazis. A lawyer for Nazi victims who sued the banks said the agreement could allow the victims or their descendants to obtain hundreds of millions of dollars in unclaimed funds. If Swiss authorities approve the agreement, Credit Suisse and UBS AG will publish the names of 3,000 accounts opened during the Nazi era. They will open databases of Nazi-era accounts for comparison with a list of thousands hoping to recover family assets from Swiss banks.■ MexicoBounty on prosecutor's headThree major drug cartels in Mexico are offering rewards of more than US$2 million to assassinate Mexican Attorney General Rafael Macedo de la Concha, press reports said Wednesday. Deputy Attorney General Jose Luis Santiago Vasconcelos told reporters that death threats to Macedo and to himself have been received from the Gulf cartel, led by Osiel Cardenas, who is in prison; from the Tijuana cartel, which is run by the Arellano Felix brothers; and from the so-called Millennium cartel, headed by drug lord Armando Valencia.■ United StatesChickens get justiceSeven Georgia teenagers who beheaded two chickens because they were curious whether they would run around with their heads cut off will soon learn a lot more about the birds. A judge ordered the five boys and two girls  --  ages 17 to 19  --  to clean chicken coops and read a book about animal cruelty as part of their sentence. Last September the seven teens bought machetes, kitchen knives and a hatchet, then drove to a farm and stole eight chickens. They beheaded two of them, videotaping the carnage before the homeowner caught them. The chickens "sort of ran a very short distance and they sort of flopped over," defense attorney Garland Moore said.■ United StatesEl Paso sweatiest US cityEl Paso, Texas, with average summer temperatures above 34?C and relative humidity over 70 percent, is the sweatiest city in the US, according to a study released on Tuesday. Research scientist Tim Long calculated heat indexes and relative humidity levels to come up with his top 100 sweatiest cities in the US list. By Long's calculations, in just four hours, El Paso's residents produce enough sweat to fill an Olympic swimming pool, with individuals shedding more than 1 liter of perspiration an hour. "The driving force is heat, but humidity is a key factor," Long said.■ United KingdomMonogamy gene foundA single gene inserted into the brain can change promiscuous male rodents into faithful, monogamous partners, scientists said on Wednesday. It may not be quite that simple to rein in human philanderers  --  many genes as well as other factors are probably involved in relationships among people. But researchers at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center of Emory University and Atlanta's Center for Behavioral Neuroscience (CBN) in the US said their results could help to explain the neurobiology of romantic love. The study suggests that "changes in the activity of a single gene profoundly can change a fundamental social behavior of animals within a species," said Larry Young, a researcher at the university.■ RussiaUS, Russia work togetherA Russian Proton-M booster rocket blasted into space early yesterday, carrying a US satellite, Russian space officials said. The rocket was launched from Russia's Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on schedule at 2:27am Moscow time, said Alexander Bobrinyov of the Khrunichev space company.The Intelsat-10 satellite, when in orbit around the Earth, will be used to provide live television broadcasting, telephone communications and Internet connections to Intelsat's customers in South America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.■ United StatesCow manure pollutesAir quality regulators are proposing what they say would be the first attempt in America to regulate smog-forming emissions from cow manure. Cows in southern California dairies, especially around the farm community of Chino, produce 1 million tonnes of manure every year, according to the South Coast Air Quality Management District, which is proposing the new rules. As it decomposes, the manure releases more than 20 tonnes of pollutants daily  --  mostly ammonia  --  and combines with pollution blown downwind from Los Angeles and Orange counties, aggravating Southern California's worst-in-the-nation smog problem.■ PortugalIrishman steals ambulanceAn Irish man was to appear in court in southern Portugal on Wednesday after he stole an ambulance and briefly drove it while   drunk, police said. Paramedics left their keys in the ignition of the ambulance while they attended to a patient in a house in Portimao, 250km south of Lisbon, police spokesman Alexandre Coimbra said. The Irish man then made off with the ambulance but was stopped by police after having driven just 200m, he added. No one was hurt in the incident. The man was found to have 2.8 grams of alcohol per liter in his blood, far in excess of the national drink-drive limit of 0.5 grams. He was charged with automobile theft and drink driving, Coimbra said.■ ZimbabweMugabe admits HIV in familyThe Zimbabwean president, Robert Mugabe, admitted for the first time on Wednesday that members of his family had been affected by HIV/Aids. Mugabe told a conference on Aids that unnamed members of his family had become ill from the disease. Describing HIV/Aids as "one of the greatest challenges facing our nation," he said that most people had been affected "and that includes the extended family of the president himself." The admission came after years of official neglect of a virus that has infected almost a quarter of adults in Zimbabwe, one of the highest prevalence rates in the world. Last year, 1.8 million Zimbabweans were infected and a recent survey found that 51 percent of prisoners were HIV-positive.■ CongoRefugees escape to BurundiMore than 22,000 refugees have fled into neighboring Burundi to escape heightened tensions in eastern Congo, officials said, after weeks of strife between loyalists and former rebels that have rattled the peace process in Africa's third-largest nation. UN investigators gave their first detailed accounts Wednesday of the violence, saying doctors registered 143 civilian casualties  --  including 66 dead  --  in a takeover of the eastern city of Bukavu by renegade ex-rebel military forces that sparked the fighting.This story has been viewed 465 times.#*#Copyright © 1999-2004 The Taipei Times.

       Search the Archive:            February 27, 2004Back to the table of Contents Page Classifieds Palo Alto Online   Publication Date: Friday, February 27, 2004   Gunn, M-A boys booted from CCS soccerGunn, M-A boys booted from CCS soccer  (February 27, 2004)      by Keith PetersA considerable rebuilding effort will be under way at Menlo-Atherton and Gunn next season, as the boys' soccer teams patch things up in hopes of taking another step forward.     	Both squads reached the Central Coast Section Division I semifinals on Tuesday at PAL Stadium in San Jose, and both suffered lopsided losses.Second-seeded Gunn (15-4-5) dropped a 4-1 decision to No. 3 Gilroy (21-0-5) while No. 4 Menlo-Atherton (13-4-6) was eliminated following a 3-1 loss to No. 1 Watsonville (24-1-1).For the Titans, they'll lose 10 players off a team that had hoped to win a second straight Division I championship. For the Bears, 16 players on their 25-man roster will depart - including offensive star Javier Hil.Gunn will return 10 players, eight of whom had considerable experience as starters. A plus for the Titans is their JV team was unbeaten this season. Menlo-Atherton, meanwhile, returns only six players, two of whom started, but isn't as blessed by a successful JV team as Gunn is.Still, that's a lot of lost experience by teams hoping to take the next step forward, which would be to reach next year's championship match. Their best shots, of course, came Tuesday night against two very good, talented opponents.Hil said he and his teammates played Watsonville fairly even during the first 15-20 minutes, "but, over 80 minutes, Watsonville was the better team."Menlo-Atherton coach Juan Camahort agreed."Watsonville is just too good," he said. "There's no weaknesses on that team."Still, the Bears trailed by only 1-0 at the half following a goal by the Wildcatz in the 37th minute. Menlo-Atherton would have been leading at that point, had senior Alex Ruck's shot that hit the crossbar been a bit lower. However, it bounced straight down to Hil, whose shot was saved by keeper Israel Cisneros.M-A failed to capitalize on another opportunity when Hil's shot was blocked and bounced to senior Robert Kent, who missed an open shot from 12 yards out.Watsonville, meanwhile, made the most of its chances - despite some fine goalie work by senior Anthony Nikolchev and senior sweeper Darren Borcherdt.Hil gave M-A's its only goal in stoppage time. Moments later, the Bears' season was over.Departing along with Hil, Ruck, Kent, Borchert and Nikolchev will be fellow seniors Xeronimo Castaneda, Ricardo Correa, Chris Hodgin, Edgar Lara, Ramon Madriz, Matthew Mason, Rex Pechler, Armando Valencia, Guillermo Ortiz, Eliseo Arteaga and Jonathan Rodriguez.Gunn's hopes for a title defense ended quickly after the Titans took the field following M-A's loss. Gilroy jumped out quickly to a 3-0 first-half lead, scoring on three of its first four shots in the first 30 minutes to remove any doubt to the game's outcome. While Gunn did recover from a 3-0 deficit during the SCVAL De Anza Division season, the caliber of talent at the CCS level pretty much excludes such a comeback.The Titans had only one shot on goal in the first half and missed some opportunities in the second half, before Matt Marquess connected off a cross from fellow senior Pablo Rivera. Earlier, junior Alex Guzinski headed a shot off the crossbar and junior Ryan McDermott had a point-blank shot saved by Gilroy's goalie and just missed wide on another attempt.Along with Marquess and Rivera, Gunn loses seniors Colin Van Hare, Mark Johnston, Nick Marsh, Eadon Jacobs, Nitzan Zorman, Bobby Bateman, Allon Jacobs and Oleg Volfovskiy. E-mail a friend a link to this story.

Errol Chavez, DEA(AP) Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, Mexico's new No. 1 drug lord, rose to the top by eliminating rivals, winning over Colombian cocaine producers and evading a 19-month U.S.-Mexico effort to smash his smuggling syndicate, investigators told The Associated Press.Zambada is hardly a household name, yet he has become the most wanted drug smuggler in Mexico and is expected to be added soon to the FBI's Top 10 Most-Wanted Fugitives list, U.S. and Mexican drug agents told AP.Mexico's top anti-drug prosecutor, Jose Santiago Vasconcelos, called Zambada "drug dealer No. 1" and said the fugitive has become more powerful as his fellow kingpins have fallen, including one who was allegedly killed on Zambada's orders."With all the other groups, we have captured the leaders," Vasconcelos said at his heavily guarded Mexico City office. "He's the only leader we haven't caught."Zambada's organization was the target of "Operation Trifecta," a 19-month, U.S.-Mexican sting that ended July 31. Authorities say they collared 240 suspected drug smugglers in the United States and Mexico, seized nearly six tons of cocaine and unsealed U.S. federal indictments against Zambada, his son and his key cocaine distributor.Errol Chavez, head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's Arizona division, said the operation confirmed "the scope of (Zambada's) influence in Mexico is legendary," spanning nearly 30 years.Zambada, the 55-year-old leader of a drug gang based in the Pacific Coast resort city of Mazatlan, has formed alliances with "almost every known drug trafficking group in Mexico," Chavez said.No one knows exactly how much Mexico's drug trade - or Zambada's sizable share of it - are worth, but the White House estimates about half the $65 billion in narcotics that Americans buy each year comes through Mexico.Zambada has been charged with organized crime and drug trafficking in Mexico, and a U.S. indictment charges him with conspiring to smuggle cocaine.Zambada's rise to the top of Mexico's drug ranks began in February 2002, when police in Mazatlan shot and killed Ramon Arellano Felix. The feared enforcer for the Tijuana-based smuggling gang bearing his family's name, Arellano Felix had been on the list of the FBI's 10 most-wanted fugitives.Chavez and U.S. investigators in Mexico City who spoke on the condition of anonymity said Zambada lured Arellano Felix to his home turf and paid the police officers who killed him, although Mexican officials won't confirm that. Zambada has never been charged in the case.Zambada got another boost a month later, when authorities captured Ramon Arellano Felix's brother Benjamin, the Arellano Felix gang's operations chief.The Arellano Felix gang was Mexico's most powerful smuggling syndicate from the late 1990s until the death of Ramon Arellano Felix and the capture of Benjamin Arellano Felix.Many investigators on both sides of the border speculated that no one drug lord would step up and fill the power vacuum left by a weakened Arellano Felix gang.But Chavez said Zambada rose to power by winning the trust of Colombian cocaine producers in a way the Arellano Felix gang never could, allowing his organization to move more cocaine into the United States than most other smuggling syndicates."There were financial problems between the (Arellano Felix organization) and the Colombians," Chavez said, noting that as the Arellano Felix brothers fell, "bills went unpaid and the Colombians sought other trafficking organizations they trusted more.""They sought out El Mayo," he explained.Zambada formed close ties to a Colombian cocaine producing organization believed to be run by twin brothers Miguel and Victor Mejia Munera, U.S. investigators say.Arellano Felix syndicate smugglers still bring tons of cocaine into the United States via Tijuana. Rather than challenge the rival gang's authority between Baja California and California, Zambada has tightened his control of smuggling routes leading from neighboring Sonora state into Arizona, authorities say.Chavez said his office is stationing more DEA agents and informants in Sonora and southernmost Arizona in an effort to further target Zambada's group. The DEA also has received special funding for highway billboards between Tucson and Phoenix featuring a wanted poster of Zambada.Zambada remains a bitter enemy of the Arellano Felix gang, but is close to accused Juarez cartel leader Vicente Carrillo Fuentes and has reached out to Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, a convicted drug lord who escaped from prison and specializes in building drug tunnels under the U.S. border, authorities say."El Mayo is more of the businessman, the guy who wants to cooperate and bring people together," Chavez said. "He and El Chapo are very close. They have helped each other become very successful in Arizona."Originally from Sinaloa state where Mazatlan is located, Zambada got his start as an enforcer and hit man for the Juarez cartel based in the border city of the same name.Investigators can't agree on when he founded his own group of freelance smugglers. Mexico's attorney general's office still listed him as one of the heads of Juarez cartel's operations in Sinaloa as recently as 1998, but Chavez and other DEA officials said Zambada began working to form his own group in Mazatlan more than a decade ago.Mexico has taken out several top drug lords over the past two years. Besides the Arellano Felix brothers, police and soldiers collared Osiel Cardenas, the alleged head of the gulf cartel, in March. Last month, they caught up with Armando Valencia, one of thealleged heads of a drug gang based in the central state of Michoacan.Chavez said the DEA is watching family members Zambada has in the United States, but there's no evidence he has crossed the border. In August, Mexican special agents stormed homes in Sonora state's capital, Hermosillo, arresting one Zambada associate.Chavez said authorities were "one step away from El Chapo and two steps away from El Mayo.""It came down to timing," he said. "Our timing wasn't right."By Will Weissert©MMIII, The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

The Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court on Tuesday completed the appeal case of Yu Huafeng (喻華峰), the former vice chief editor of the paper, reducing his sentence for corruption to eight years from 12. Li Minying (李民英), the former deputy Communist Party head of the paper, had his sentence reduced from 11 years to six years. The two were jailed on corruption charges linked to the routine distribution of bonuses at the paper.■ Hong KongMass arrests in brothelsOfficers have arrested 107 people in three days of raids on brothels suspected to have ties to Chinese crime gangs, police said yesterday. The raids occurred in Mongkok, a popular tourist area notorious for prostitution, police spokeswoman Kelly Chan said. Five men, aged 33 to 50, were charged with conspiracy to manage a vice establishment. A 33-year-old man was charged with conspiracy to traffic women to Hong Kong for prostitution, a police statement said. Thirty-three women from China, aged 15 to 45, were charged with violating their visitor visas. The remaining 68 suspects were still being detained for questioning, Chan said.■ AustraliaInsanity for shooterAn honors student who went on a shooting spree that killed two people and wounded five at an Australian university was declared innocent Thursday of murder and attempted murder on the grounds of insanity. The shooting spree at Monash University in Melbourne in 2002 shocked this nation, where violence at schools and university campuses are rare. Despite clearing 38-year-old Huan Xiang of two counts of murder and five of attempted murder, Victorian Supreme Court judge justice Bernard Teague ordered that he be detained in a secure psychiatric institution for 25 years.■ VietnamCross-border bus on trackVietnam and Thailand have cleared a snag over which side of a bus should have the steering wheel and reached a tentative agreement on launching a cross-border tourist bus service, a Vietnamese tourism official said yesterday. Progress on the bus service held up because of Vietnam's ban on vehicles with steering wheels on the right-hand side  --  standard for vehicles from Thailand, where they are driven on the left side of the street. Vietnam, where cars are driven on the right, has now agreed to allow the Thai buses to operate in the communist country.■ AntarcticaJapanese garbage clearedJapanese researchers in Antarctica are getting serious about cleaning up the half-century's worth of garbage piled up at their base on the southernmost continent, an official said yesterday. Building materials, cast-off snow vehicles and fuel drums have collected at the research base since the first expedition was launched in 1956. By 1998, the garbage weighed about 500 tonnes and research teams began chipping away at the pile to clear it. Now, those efforts are being accelerated in an international effort to clean up Antarctica. Japan's Science Ministry hopes to send the remaining 337 tonnes of garbage home within four years, a ministry official said.■ SwitzerlandBanks release war recordsSwiss banks have agreed to release records of thousands of World War II-era accounts that may belong to victims of the Nazis. A lawyer for Nazi victims who sued the banks said the agreement could allow the victims or their descendants to obtain hundreds of millions of dollars in unclaimed funds. If Swiss authorities approve the agreement, Credit Suisse and UBS AG will publish the names of 3,000 accounts opened during the Nazi era. They will open databases of Nazi-era accounts for comparison with a list of thousands hoping to recover family assets from Swiss banks.■ MexicoBounty on prosecutor's headThree major drug cartels in Mexico are offering rewards of more than US$2 million to assassinate Mexican Attorney General Rafael Macedo de la Concha, press reports said Wednesday. Deputy Attorney General Jose Luis Santiago Vasconcelos told reporters that death threats to Macedo and to himself have been received from the Gulf cartel, led by Osiel Cardenas, who is in prison; from the Tijuana cartel, which is run by the Arellano Felix brothers; and from the so-called Millennium cartel, headed by drug lord Armando Valencia.■ United StatesChickens get justiceSeven Georgia teenagers who beheaded two chickens because they were curious whether they would run around with their heads cut off will soon learn a lot more about the birds. A judge ordered the five boys and two girls  --  ages 17 to 19  --  to clean chicken coops and read a book about animal cruelty as part of their sentence. Last September the seven teens bought machetes, kitchen knives and a hatchet, then drove to a farm and stole eight chickens. They beheaded two of them, videotaping the carnage before the homeowner caught them. The chickens "sort of ran a very short distance and they sort of flopped over," defense attorney Garland Moore said.■ United StatesEl Paso sweatiest US cityEl Paso, Texas, with average summer temperatures above 34?C and relative humidity over 70 percent, is the sweatiest city in the US, according to a study released on Tuesday. Research scientist Tim Long calculated heat indexes and relative humidity levels to come up with his top 100 sweatiest cities in the US list. By Long's calculations, in just four hours, El Paso's residents produce enough sweat to fill an Olympic swimming pool, with individuals shedding more than 1 liter of perspiration an hour. "The driving force is heat, but humidity is a key factor," Long said.■ United KingdomMonogamy gene foundA single gene inserted into the brain can change promiscuous male rodents into faithful, monogamous partners, scientists said on Wednesday. It may not be quite that simple to rein in human philanderers  --  many genes as well as other factors are probably involved in relationships among people. But researchers at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center of Emory University and Atlanta's Center for Behavioral Neuroscience (CBN) in the US said their results could help to explain the neurobiology of romantic love. The study suggests that "changes in the activity of a single gene profoundly can change a fundamental social behavior of animals within a species," said Larry Young, a researcher at the university.■ RussiaUS, Russia work togetherA Russian Proton-M booster rocket blasted into space early yesterday, carrying a US satellite, Russian space officials said. The rocket was launched from Russia's Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on schedule at 2:27am Moscow time, said Alexander Bobrinyov of the Khrunichev space company.The Intelsat-10 satellite, when in orbit around the Earth, will be used to provide live television broadcasting, telephone communications and Internet connections to Intelsat's customers in South America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.■ United StatesCow manure pollutesAir quality regulators are proposing what they say would be the first attempt in America to regulate smog-forming emissions from cow manure. Cows in southern California dairies, especially around the farm community of Chino, produce 1 million tonnes of manure every year, according to the South Coast Air Quality Management District, which is proposing the new rules. As it decomposes, the manure releases more than 20 tonnes of pollutants daily  --  mostly ammonia  --  and combines with pollution blown downwind from Los Angeles and Orange counties, aggravating Southern California's worst-in-the-nation smog problem.■ PortugalIrishman steals ambulanceAn Irish man was to appear in court in southern Portugal on Wednesday after he stole an ambulance and briefly drove it while   drunk, police said. Paramedics left their keys in the ignition of the ambulance while they attended to a patient in a house in Portimao, 250km south of Lisbon, police spokesman Alexandre Coimbra said. The Irish man then made off with the ambulance but was stopped by police after having driven just 200m, he added. No one was hurt in the incident. The man was found to have 2.8 grams of alcohol per liter in his blood, far in excess of the national drink-drive limit of 0.5 grams. He was charged with automobile theft and drink driving, Coimbra said.■ ZimbabweMugabe admits HIV in familyThe Zimbabwean president, Robert Mugabe, admitted for the first time on Wednesday that members of his family had been affected by HIV/Aids. Mugabe told a conference on Aids that unnamed members of his family had become ill from the disease. Describing HIV/Aids as "one of the greatest challenges facing our nation," he said that most people had been affected "and that includes the extended family of the president himself." The admission came after years of official neglect of a virus that has infected almost a quarter of adults in Zimbabwe, one of the highest prevalence rates in the world. Last year, 1.8 million Zimbabweans were infected and a recent survey found that 51 percent of prisoners were HIV-positive.■ CongoRefugees escape to BurundiMore than 22,000 refugees have fled into neighboring Burundi to escape heightened tensions in eastern Congo, officials said, after weeks of strife between loyalists and former rebels that have rattled the peace process in Africa's third-largest nation. UN investigators gave their first detailed accounts Wednesday of the violence, saying doctors registered 143 civilian casualties  --  including 66 dead  --  in a takeover of the eastern city of Bukavu by renegade ex-rebel military forces that sparked the fighting.This story has been viewed 465 times.Copyright © 1999-2004 The Taipei Times.

The Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court on Tuesday completed the appeal case of Yu Huafeng (喻華峰), the former vice chief editor of the paper, reducing his sentence for corruption to eight years from 12. Li Minying (李民英), the former deputy Communist Party head of the paper, had his sentence reduced from 11 years to six years. The two were jailed on corruption charges linked to the routine distribution of bonuses at the paper.■ Hong KongMass arrests in brothelsOfficers have arrested 107 people in three days of raids on brothels suspected to have ties to Chinese crime gangs, police said yesterday. The raids occurred in Mongkok, a popular tourist area notorious for prostitution, police spokeswoman Kelly Chan said. Five men, aged 33 to 50, were charged with conspiracy to manage a vice establishment. A 33-year-old man was charged with conspiracy to traffic women to Hong Kong for prostitution, a police statement said. Thirty-three women from China, aged 15 to 45, were charged with violating their visitor visas. The remaining 68 suspects were still being detained for questioning, Chan said.■ AustraliaInsanity for shooterAn honors student who went on a shooting spree that killed two people and wounded five at an Australian university was declared innocent Thursday of murder and attempted murder on the grounds of insanity. The shooting spree at Monash University in Melbourne in 2002 shocked this nation, where violence at schools and university campuses are rare. Despite clearing 38-year-old Huan Xiang of two counts of murder and five of attempted murder, Victorian Supreme Court judge justice Bernard Teague ordered that he be detained in a secure psychiatric institution for 25 years.■ VietnamCross-border bus on trackVietnam and Thailand have cleared a snag over which side of a bus should have the steering wheel and reached a tentative agreement on launching a cross-border tourist bus service, a Vietnamese tourism official said yesterday. Progress on the bus service held up because of Vietnam's ban on vehicles with steering wheels on the right-hand side  --  standard for vehicles from Thailand, where they are driven on the left side of the street. Vietnam, where cars are driven on the right, has now agreed to allow the Thai buses to operate in the communist country.■ AntarcticaJapanese garbage clearedJapanese researchers in Antarctica are getting serious about cleaning up the half-century's worth of garbage piled up at their base on the southernmost continent, an official said yesterday. Building materials, cast-off snow vehicles and fuel drums have collected at the research base since the first expedition was launched in 1956. By 1998, the garbage weighed about 500 tonnes and research teams began chipping away at the pile to clear it. Now, those efforts are being accelerated in an international effort to clean up Antarctica. Japan's Science Ministry hopes to send the remaining 337 tonnes of garbage home within four years, a ministry official said.■ SwitzerlandBanks release war recordsSwiss banks have agreed to release records of thousands of World War II-era accounts that may belong to victims of the Nazis. A lawyer for Nazi victims who sued the banks said the agreement could allow the victims or their descendants to obtain hundreds of millions of dollars in unclaimed funds. If Swiss authorities approve the agreement, Credit Suisse and UBS AG will publish the names of 3,000 accounts opened during the Nazi era. They will open databases of Nazi-era accounts for comparison with a list of thousands hoping to recover family assets from Swiss banks.■ MexicoBounty on prosecutor's headThree major drug cartels in Mexico are offering rewards of more than US$2 million to assassinate Mexican Attorney General Rafael Macedo de la Concha, press reports said Wednesday. Deputy Attorney General Jose Luis Santiago Vasconcelos told reporters that death threats to Macedo and to himself have been received from the Gulf cartel, led by Osiel Cardenas, who is in prison; from the Tijuana cartel, which is run by the Arellano Felix brothers; and from the so-called Millennium cartel, headed by drug lord Armando Valencia.■ United StatesChickens get justiceSeven Georgia teenagers who beheaded two chickens because they were curious whether they would run around with their heads cut off will soon learn a lot more about the birds. A judge ordered the five boys and two girls  --  ages 17 to 19  --  to clean chicken coops and read a book about animal cruelty as part of their sentence. Last September the seven teens bought machetes, kitchen knives and a hatchet, then drove to a farm and stole eight chickens. They beheaded two of them, videotaping the carnage before the homeowner caught them. The chickens "sort of ran a very short distance and they sort of flopped over," defense attorney Garland Moore said.■ United StatesEl Paso sweatiest US cityEl Paso, Texas, with average summer temperatures above 34?C and relative humidity over 70 percent, is the sweatiest city in the US, according to a study released on Tuesday. Research scientist Tim Long calculated heat indexes and relative humidity levels to come up with his top 100 sweatiest cities in the US list. By Long's calculations, in just four hours, El Paso's residents produce enough sweat to fill an Olympic swimming pool, with individuals shedding more than 1 liter of perspiration an hour. "The driving force is heat, but humidity is a key factor," Long said.■ United KingdomMonogamy gene foundA single gene inserted into the brain can change promiscuous male rodents into faithful, monogamous partners, scientists said on Wednesday. It may not be quite that simple to rein in human philanderers  --  many genes as well as other factors are probably involved in relationships among people. But researchers at the Yerkes National Primate Research Center of Emory University and Atlanta's Center for Behavioral Neuroscience (CBN) in the US said their results could help to explain the neurobiology of romantic love. The study suggests that "changes in the activity of a single gene profoundly can change a fundamental social behavior of animals within a species," said Larry Young, a researcher at the university.■ RussiaUS, Russia work togetherA Russian Proton-M booster rocket blasted into space early yesterday, carrying a US satellite, Russian space officials said. The rocket was launched from Russia's Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on schedule at 2:27am Moscow time, said Alexander Bobrinyov of the Khrunichev space company.The Intelsat-10 satellite, when in orbit around the Earth, will be used to provide live television broadcasting, telephone communications and Internet connections to Intelsat's customers in South America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.■ United StatesCow manure pollutesAir quality regulators are proposing what they say would be the first attempt in America to regulate smog-forming emissions from cow manure. Cows in southern California dairies, especially around the farm community of Chino, produce 1 million tonnes of manure every year, according to the South Coast Air Quality Management District, which is proposing the new rules. As it decomposes, the manure releases more than 20 tonnes of pollutants daily  --  mostly ammonia  --  and combines with pollution blown downwind from Los Angeles and Orange counties, aggravating Southern California's worst-in-the-nation smog problem.■ PortugalIrishman steals ambulanceAn Irish man was to appear in court in southern Portugal on Wednesday after he stole an ambulance and briefly drove it while   drunk, police said. Paramedics left their keys in the ignition of the ambulance while they attended to a patient in a house in Portimao, 250km south of Lisbon, police spokesman Alexandre Coimbra said. The Irish man then made off with the ambulance but was stopped by police after having driven just 200m, he added. No one was hurt in the incident. The man was found to have 2.8 grams of alcohol per liter in his blood, far in excess of the national drink-drive limit of 0.5 grams. He was charged with automobile theft and drink driving, Coimbra said.■ ZimbabweMugabe admits HIV in familyThe Zimbabwean president, Robert Mugabe, admitted for the first time on Wednesday that members of his family had been affected by HIV/Aids. Mugabe told a conference on Aids that unnamed members of his family had become ill from the disease. Describing HIV/Aids as "one of the greatest challenges facing our nation," he said that most people had been affected "and that includes the extended family of the president himself." The admission came after years of official neglect of a virus that has infected almost a quarter of adults in Zimbabwe, one of the highest prevalence rates in the world.

Fayette drug agents participate in federal sting to take out Mexican smugglers in Atlanta Sunday, August 31, 2003Fayette drugagents participate in federal sting to take out Mexican smugglers in AtlantaBy JOHNMUNFORDjmunford@TheCitizenNews.comThe FayetteCounty Sheriff's Department's Drug Task Force was lauded Thursday forits participation in a federal drug sting that targeted a Mexican organizationdistributing drugs in the metro Atlanta area. Last week,Fayette drug agents helped arrest 24 suspects and seize $3.1 million incash as over 200 law enforcement officers executed search warrants on19 locations in metro Atlanta last week, said U.S. Attorney William S.Duffey Jr. Authorities confiscated 254 kilograms of cocaine, 500 poundsof marijuana, two pounds of methamphetamine and a half-pound of "ice,"which is liquid methamphetamine. The Fayettedrug agents played a crucial role in the sting, particularly with surveillanceoperations, said W. Michael Furgason, Sr., special agent in charge ofthe Drug Enforcement Administration. "They'rea great narcotics team and they bring a lot of experience we rely on,"Furgason said. "It's just that they're good cops." Fayette CountySheriff Randall Johnson said the bust was one of the biggest the departmenthas ever participated in. "It'sthe opportunity of a lifetime to be in on a drug bust this size,"Johnson said. The 24 suspectshave all been charged in federal court with conspiring to distribute andsell drugs in the area, Duffey said. Most of those arrested were immigrantsliving illegally in the country, Furgason added. The bust wasannounced at a news conference in Atlanta Thursday morning. Although noneof the drug activity took place in Fayette County, Sheriff Johnson saidit is important to help cut drug trafficking in the area before they aredistributed here. "We wantthem (criminals) to know they'd better not come in here with it,"Johnson said. "They know where the county line is now." The FayetteCounty Drug Task Force is comprised of agents from the Fayette CountySheriff's Department, the Tyrone Police Department and the Pike CountySheriff's Department. Duffey saidthe Armando Valencia organization would import the drugs from Mexico andstash them in large vehicles such as tractor trailers for transport intocities like Atlanta. As the 18-monthinvestigation continued, it became more apparent that the Valencia organizationwas very dangerous, Duffey said. When the search warrants were servedby officers early one morning, one suspect was found sleeping next toa gun, Duffey said. Anyone whosleeps with a weapon within arm's reach "is prepared to use it whenit has to be used," Duffey noted. "Theseare professional dealers," Furgason said. Although noconnections could be made to the Valencia organization, federal drug agentshave learned that many unsolved homicides are tied to drug traffickingin general. Authoritiesdecided to target the Valencia organization because "it was the onewe knew the least about," Duffey said. The investigation revealedthe gang was very sophisticated in its operations, particularly in theamount of time they spent trying to learn about law enforcement techniques.Members ofthe Valencia organization would spend as much time doing that counterintelligenceas they would actually selling the drugs, Duffey noted. The goal ofthe operation was to "dismantle" the Valencia organization,Duffey said. The head of the organization, Armando Valencia himself, wasarrested in Mexico with cooperation from authorities there, Duffey said.The drugs wouldtravel from Reynosa, Mexico to McAllen, Tex., to Atlanta and beyond toKnoxville, Tenn., Furgason said. Officers founddrugs in four metro Atlanta locations, at residences in Lilburn, Smyrna,Norcross and Roswell, authorities said. Although Duffeyrefused to go into details about what agents learned about the Valenciaorganization or how the investigation was conducted, he said agents usedjust about every investigative tactic in the book.

The snow was thin from the big storm they had on November 8, 9&10, and now it was 3 weeks later with 2 of those weeks sunny and highs in the 50's.  They had one week with lows above freezing at Mammoth Pass (9300').There were 17 of us in two condo's and 4 more staying nearby.  Barbara drove up early Wednesday (Nov 27) so that she could bake pies and get some vegetables ready.  She had ordered two Turkey Dinner Kits from Vons, but she was going to augment them.  I have asked her to describe the menu in more detail, because it was the high point of the trip.  We ate like kings!I drove up Wednesday afternoon with two others, and listened to AKUS (Allison Krauss and Union Station, Live) the whole way.  The traffic was very bad in San Diego, and again in San Bernardino Co.  A two hour drive slowed to three.  Once we started up Cajon Pass, we cruised.  We got to the condo about 12:30 AM.  I shared a bunk room with Fred, Armando, and Mike Salomon.Thursday morning we met Barbara, Sue Pease, Patty Dahl, Armando Valencia, and Mike Salomon.  Norma Schwartz and Fred Gabbard drove up with me.  Alice, Bill and Luba Belkina were driving up that morning. The other condo had a contingent from the 20s & 30s section headed by Brad Buffett.  We saw them at dinner time.We drove up to Tamarack Lodge and walked up the road about a mile and started to ski.  The snow was very hard and crunchy.  They had groomed it and were charging $11 to ski it, but we were headed for the back country.  We skied up a hiking trail to Emerald Lake, had lunch, and started back.  The first real ski day of the season is best kept short. I could feel the altitude.  Four of us explored a little further on a ridge that we would ski later in the trip.  We caught up with the rest of the group, and I coached Mike Salomon down the slope.  We thought he could ski because he brought randonee ski gear.  It was his first day on skis!  I showed him how to snow plow, and he became the slowest skier on the mountain.We finally got back after 4 PM, and Barbara had picked up the turkeys at two.  The kitchen was in full production.  Someone noticed that we often had 9 of us in the little space.  Sweet potatoes were being peeled, string beans sliced, salad assembled and as you might have guessed, I dissected two big pomegranates for the salad.  The smell of roasting bird filled the whole condo area.  Wine bottles were opened, and the condo filled with skiers.  We opened a 1000 piece jigsaw puzzle, and the TV finally settled on the James Bond Marathon (all Bond, all the time). Barbara had been telling us that dinner would be ready about 7, and she was right on the money.  I even had time for a shower.The meal was wonderful.  All you could hear was chewing and gasps of joy.  Barbara had to explain again and again how each dish was prepared.  I limited myself to one plate of food, but of course it was piled very high.  I wanted to save room for those pies!  The celebration lasted until 10, and the other condo people headed home so Patty could have her bed on the couch.Friday morning was our first full ski day.  We waited for the other condo, but finally realized that they were going downhill that day ($60 lift tickets at Mammoth Mtn!) (photo of minarets from mountaintop).  We drove back to Tamarack, and walked up the road again, but this time we headed west to Mammoth Pass.  We hurried through the CO2 area with its dead trees and one fatality and cheated death once again.  We climbed toward the past with several pausing to skin up.  We reached McCloud Lake at noon and enjoyed lunch in the sun.  The lake was frozen, but only Alvin risked skiing out on it.  After lunch (turkey sandwiches of course) we skied past the lake and turned north toward the back side of Mammoth Mtn.  I had never skied there and found it too be a wonderful playground of ridges, plateaus, lots of soft snow, and occasional glimpses of the Minarets and the Ritter Range. We realized that we could ski all the way around Mammoth Mtn and use the shuttle bus to get home.  Unfortunately, the weather was starting to change, so we headed east and skied down a very cool ravine to Horseshoe Lake and back the groomed road to the cars.  Everyone was very pleased that we had found yet another fine place to ski.  I have been skiing at Mammoth for about 30 years, and I find someplace new each time.Friday dinner was Pizza from Giovani's, and lots of leftovers.  I learned on previous trips, that you didn't have to buy anymore food besides the big dinner.  The puzzle was taking form and James Bond was being chased all over the planet.  It started snowing that night, but the Weather Channel forecast only 1 inch of accumulation.  What would tomorrow bring?Saturday morning it was still snowing, but only the inch was on the ground, our cars, and the road.  I drove very slowly and carefully up to Tamarack without chains.  There were cars, trucks, and SUVs spun out all over the place.  I had to get around a shuttle bus that had stopped for passengers, and the oncoming traffic yielded to our frantic gestures.  I don't think I could have started up again if I had stopped.From Tamarack, we only had to walk a short distance before we started skiing.  Now we had almost the whole bunch, so we split into two groups.  I took the stronger skiers back to Emerald Lake for lunch (more turkey sandwiches) while the others enjoyed the Lake Mary area (photos of reflection and mood).  We all continued up the ridge in very light snowfall, and I missed the direct path over to the Duck Lake trail.  We skied along an old pack trail, and descended down a fairly steep hillside, but the snow was good, and everyone did OK.  We reached the trailhead and the groomed road right away, so we visited the Mammoth Consolidated Mine.  There are old miner's cabins, mining machinery, and the shaft with the steel bar gate to keep us out.  An easy ski back to the cars, and we were done for the day.Dinner that night was soup and the last of the leftovers.  I can't remember Barbara's name for it, but it was souperb!  We finished the puzzle while James Bond saved the world and won the girl.Most of us left Sunday morning, but the other condo all (except Kristi) stayed and skied another day.  Kristi (photo) had to work Monday, so she drove back with me.  We stopped at the Galen Rowell Mountain Light Gallery in Bishop and were stunned with his work.  Nearly all of us that had left that morning stopped there.  Galen and his wife were killed in a small plane crash in August.  We learned that their heirs will continue to run the gallery and produce his books and prints.  You can visit their web site and see some of his work. I bought some books for Xmas presents.  Later, we drove through Manzanar and saw the new interpretive signs and brochures.  They are turning the old High School Gym into a visitor's center.We had heavy traffic at Kramer Junction, and again in Adelanto.  The rest of the trip was smooth, and we arrived home about 7:30 PM.  It was a wonderful trip, good people, good food, and almost good snow.  See you in Utah for New Years!  Mike.P.S.Half the 20s & 30s contingent couldn't pass up another day of skiing so Jackie (photo), Cindy, and Gregory (photo together) spent Sunday skiing on- and off-track above Tamarack Lodge.  Angela, Brad, and Jennifer started the day slowly with shopping in town but followed up with a very rewarding trip to the Mono Lake tufa towers and nearby Panum Crater.  The crater is only 600 years old and its rim is up to 600 yards across whereas the lake is thousands of years old, older even than the explosion which uncovered Mammoth Mtn.We dined that night on tasty leftovers and departed before 9am Monday (photo from Rt 395 above Bishop), unfortunately missing the Mountain Light Gallery because it opens at 10am.  Three of us did drive through Manzanar (photos: landscape, road in grove, & cemetery memorial ) and enjoyed a long lunch at Randsburg, an old mining town north of Kramer Jct.  We encountered no traffic problems and arrived in San Diego about 5pm. -BradPhotos provided by Jackie from her digital camera; they are displayed here at 50% of their original size.Up to Top#*# http://sandiego.sierraclub.org/ski/index.asp, created December 2000 by Brad Buffett #*#Cross-country Ski Section, San Diego Chapter, Sierra ClubSan Diego Chapter  Cross-countrySki SectionSan Diego Chapteractivity sectionschapter outingswelcomedefinitionsski gearpoliciescontactsmailing listphotographs   2004-2005:schedulereportsbritish columbia trip   archives:2003-20042002-20032001-20022000-20011999-20001998-19991997-1998Updated 8/5/04 by Brad Buffett: 2004-5 schedule.2002 "Thanksgiving in Mammoth" ReportThe Mammoth trip was lots of fun.

All you could hear was chewing and gasps of joy.  Barbara had to explain again and again how each dish was prepared.  I limited myself to one plate of food, but of course it was piled very high.  I wanted to save room for those pies!  The celebration lasted until 10, and the other condo people headed home so Patty could have her bed on the couch.Friday morning was our first full ski day.  We waited for the other condo, but finally realized that they were going downhill that day ($60 lift tickets at Mammoth Mtn!) (photo of minarets from mountaintop).  We drove back to Tamarack, and walked up the road again, but this time we headed west to Mammoth Pass.  We hurried through the CO2 area with its dead trees and one fatality and cheated death once again.  We climbed toward the past with several pausing to skin up.  We reached McCloud Lake at noon and enjoyed lunch in the sun.  The lake was frozen, but only Alvin risked skiing out on it.  After lunch (turkey sandwiches of course) we skied past the lake and turned north toward the back side of Mammoth Mtn.  I had never skied there and found it too be a wonderful playground of ridges, plateaus, lots of soft snow, and occasional glimpses of the Minarets and the Ritter Range. We realized that we could ski all the way around Mammoth Mtn and use the shuttle bus to get home.  Unfortunately, the weather was starting to change, so we headed east and skied down a very cool ravine to Horseshoe Lake and back the groomed road to the cars.  Everyone was very pleased that we had found yet another fine place to ski.  I have been skiing at Mammoth for about 30 years, and I find someplace new each time.Friday dinner was Pizza from Giovani's, and lots of leftovers.  I learned on previous trips, that you didn't have to buy anymore food besides the big dinner.  The puzzle was taking form and James Bond was being chased all over the planet.  It started snowing that night, but the Weather Channel forecast only 1 inch of accumulation.  What would tomorrow bring?Saturday morning it was still snowing, but only the inch was on the ground, our cars, and the road.  I drove very slowly and carefully up to Tamarack without chains.  There were cars, trucks, and SUVs spun out all over the place.  I had to get around a shuttle bus that had stopped for passengers, and the oncoming traffic yielded to our frantic gestures.  I don't think I could have started up again if I had stopped.From Tamarack, we only had to walk a short distance before we started skiing.  Now we had almost the whole bunch, so we split into two groups.  I took the stronger skiers back to Emerald Lake for lunch (more turkey sandwiches) while the others enjoyed the Lake Mary area (photos of reflection and mood).  We all continued up the ridge in very light snowfall, and I missed the direct path over to the Duck Lake trail.  We skied along an old pack trail, and descended down a fairly steep hillside, but the snow was good, and everyone did OK.  We reached the trailhead and the groomed road right away, so we visited the Mammoth Consolidated Mine.  There are old miner's cabins, mining machinery, and the shaft with the steel bar gate to keep us out.  An easy ski back to the cars, and we were done for the day.Dinner that night was soup and the last of the leftovers.  I can't remember Barbara's name for it, but it was souperb!  We finished the puzzle while James Bond saved the world and won the girl.Most of us left Sunday morning, but the other condo all (except Kristi) stayed and skied another day.  Kristi (photo) had to work Monday, so she drove back with me.  We stopped at the Galen Rowell Mountain Light Gallery in Bishop and were stunned with his work.  Nearly all of us that had left that morning stopped there.  Galen and his wife were killed in a small plane crash in August.  We learned that their heirs will continue to run the gallery and produce his books and prints.  You can visit their web site and see some of his work. I bought some books for Xmas presents.  Later, we drove through Manzanar and saw the new interpretive signs and brochures.  They are turning the old High School Gym into a visitor's center.We had heavy traffic at Kramer Junction, and again in Adelanto.  The rest of the trip was smooth, and we arrived home about 7:30 PM.  It was a wonderful trip, good people, good food, and almost good snow.  See you in Utah for New Years!  Mike.P.S.Half the 20s & 30s contingent couldn't pass up another day of skiing so Jackie (photo), Cindy, and Gregory (photo together) spent Sunday skiing on- and off-track above Tamarack Lodge.  Angela, Brad, and Jennifer started the day slowly with shopping in town but followed up with a very rewarding trip to the Mono Lake tufa towers and nearby Panum Crater.  The crater is only 600 years old and its rim is up to 600 yards across whereas the lake is thousands of years old, older even than the explosion which uncovered Mammoth Mtn.We dined that night on tasty leftovers and departed before 9am Monday (photo from Rt 395 above Bishop), unfortunately missing the Mountain Light Gallery because it opens at 10am.  Three of us did drive through Manzanar (photos: landscape, road in grove, & cemetery memorial ) and enjoyed a long lunch at Randsburg, an old mining town north of Kramer Jct.  We encountered no traffic problems and arrived in San Diego about 5pm. -BradPhotos provided by Jackie from her digital camera; they are displayed here at 50% of their original size.Up to Top#*#

The Ceres Youth Baseball products helped lead the Modesto Cards 16-and-under baseball team to an 11th-place finish in a field of 28 at the United States Amateur Baseball Federation World Series."It's the best experience I have had in my entire life," said Valencia, whose team compiled a 4-5 record.Modesto played nine games in eight days.The 18th-seeded Cards lost to ninth-seeded Tri Valley Baseball on Friday in the first round of the single-elimination championship bracket.Modesto advanced to the championship bracket by winning two of three games in the double-elimination bracket. The Cards beat the Highlanders and San Bernardino Terror.In pool play, Modesto went 2-3. The Cards defeated the Inland Bulldogs and Showtime Baseball.Valencia, 15, missed the first week of school so he could pitch and play in the outfield for the Cards. The Ceres High sophomore played in four games."I wasn't thinking about anything out there," he said. "I was focused on baseball."Valencia pitched in three games and started one game in left field."I did good," he said. "I threw about seven innings total and didn't give up any runs with 10 strikeouts."Valencia went 3-for-4 with a double, two singles, three stolen bases and two RBIs against the Seattle Bombers."He worked his butt off," said Modesto coach Sam Nichols Jr. "He had a great attitude. Those are the kind of players you need on a championship team."Duran, a junior-to-be at Johansen High School, was relegated to the bench after getting hit by a pitch on his right wrist during his first at bat of the first game. The third baseman/pitcher played in just three games."He wasn't able to pitch for us at all this whole tournament," Nichols said. "He definitely would have helped us out. He's also our No. 4 batter."Duran had an RBI double during Modesto's 9-2 win over San Bernardino.Modesto earned a berth in the World Series by finishing second at a Super-Series Baseball of America qualifier tournament in San Jose during the Fourth of July weekend.The Cards compiled a 25-15 record this summer.Nichols assembled the team, which features players from Beyer, Central Catholic, Ceres, Davis, Downey, Hughson, Modesto Christian and Johansen, in May. More than 30 players tried out. Just 17 made the cut."I'm going to play for them next summer," Valencia said.

Tokyo Weekender - Chowtime - Tokyo Restaurants - Mexican on the cheap   HomeWeatherCNN.comJ-HelpOutdoor JapanImageK.K.from-hannaNewsletterContactTravelPast EditionsForumRestaurantsHealth & FitnessGet TechSafety Net Weekender Stories:   Charles J. WaggonWriter BioEmail the AuthorWINING & DINING   Mexican Food, Cheap and CharmingBy Charles J. Waggon'Where can a guy get a goddam good hamburger in this town?'Seems like darn near every American from west ofthe Mississippi, the minute they land in Japan, starts in a-whinin about howthey cant find good Mexican chow in Tokyo. Now, Ive met a few Mexican folkshere in Tokyo, and I dont hear them whinin so much. Aw heck, maybe they do,but theys never as LOUD as us Americans. So heres two good Mexican places; Charlie Jake sez thumbs up. Ones a cheapcantina joint where you drink and chow down on Tex Mex with your buddies. Theothers a very fine Mexican restaurant, not too expensive, and run by Mexicanfolks, of course. Don Blanco is where you go for your cheap Tex-Mex. Its acozy cantina in Shinbashi on a seedy street where every 90 seconds a young womanasked me if I wanted a massage. (If youre a man and that doesnt happen to you,then youre even older and uglier than I am.) Anyroad, youll get that bordertown feeling even before you walk in the door.  Chef Sergio Garcia (left) and Armando Valencia, owner of Posada del Sol.Posada del Sol is a one-minute walk from Shimo Takaido Station on the Keio andSetagaya Lines.Inside Don Blanco, youre gonna love all the brightcolors. Looks like a clown exploded inside, and splattered the walls. Got carvedwooden chairs and tables from Mexico, too. The real deal here is the corntortillas made fresh every day (¥300 for five), griddled to order. Thats whythey got that aroma of corn masa, amigo. Want tacos? Buy the fillings extra and roll your own; 10 kinds, all cheap. Bowlof red? Your Chili Con Carne is ¥500. They do use ground meat instead of chunksof steer beef, but it was hot enough to make even me break a sweat. Not a complete menu, but pretty close. Enchiladas are ¥600, your choice of chileverde or chile rojo. Camarones Cocktail, ¥800. Chorizo, ¥1,000. Ill warn youabout the Huevos Rancheros, my favorite hangover breakfast. Here they areactually egg tostadas, not real HRs, but theyre pretty good anyway. Cerveza? Si, señor. Lots of Mexican beers, all less than¥650. Looky here  beer is half price between 5 and 7 p.m., so my Negra Modelocost ¥280. Cant beat that in Tokyo. Tequila? All kinds, along with mezcal withthe worm (Gusano Rojo, ¥600) for a little gringo thrill. Señor Hidenori Kai opened Don Blanco seven years ago.Chili, tortillas and cerveza at Don Blanco  the best deal in Tokyo.Great place to bring your pals, and maybe a deck of cardsfor a poker game. Charlie Jake sez says thumbs up. Posada del Sol feels like a fancy restaurant in a pricey Mexican neighborhood.Bea-utiful interior, Mexican theme, and thank gawd they didnt overdo it. Maindining room, separate bar with patio-style seating. Tables of all sizes, andfancy enough to take a date.Ceviche Posada with shrimp, baby scallops, octopus and other seafood, ¥1,300.Tacos Carnitas, just like in Mexico; small soft corn tortillas, crispy porkinside, ¥900. Burrito Especiale, chicken and cheese wrapped in a large flourtortilla, fresh salsa and hot sauce on the side, ¥1,000. Chicken Mole, rich and smoky tasting sauce, nutty and spicy, with a hint ofcocoa flavor, sharing the large plate with Spanish rice and a dab of house-maderefritos, served with two soft corn tortillas in a basket. ¥1,300. ChickenEnchiladas with chile verde sauce, with rice and refritos, ¥1,000. Great Mexican food, with a few north-of-the-border favorites to keep theAmericans happy. Fair prices and pleasant service. Our waiter was Mexican. Turnsout the owner and the chef were too. Nice folks.
